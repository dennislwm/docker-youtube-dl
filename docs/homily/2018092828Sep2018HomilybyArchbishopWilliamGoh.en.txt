Life is really a mystery. We will never be able to comprehend what is truly happening in the world and we cannot control. The humanist thinks otherwise.

They think through science, through technology they can control, they can make life better. But does life really become better with technology? Yes, it can become more convenient, but with technology there is a distance in relationship. With technology, people become very impersonal. Can technology bring love? It cannot. It's the human heart that needs love. And so this is where we have to realise that we can only do our part.
Each one of us, we just simply have to do what we have to do. We just have to play our role.
If you are convinced of something, you just do it because whatever we do will also impact the future. But how much can it impact the future? This is within the plan of God. At the end of the day, we just have to trust in God. So what appears sometimes to be against us, what appears to be a setback, for God it can be a comeback. That is the mystery of life. The death of Jesus was considered a setback but it became a comeback for Jesus in the resurrection.
So today as we continue to journey in this life, let us continue to have this faith in Jesus. Do you have faith in Jesus as the Christ of God? If we do then we know somehow the Lord is in control of this world. It doesn't mean therefore we will not be purified, but through suffering perhaps we will come back and come out a better humanity, a better race.

So today, let us pray that we continue to hold on to our God, that He is our stronghold and He is our Saviour.
