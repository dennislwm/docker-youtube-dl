 and so it's important for us as we enter

 into the Easter freedom

 tomorrow then this important for us ask

 ourselves what preparations have been

 made for the Passover now the past /</c> of

 course we know in other languages in the

 European languages we call it Bhaskar

 Bhaskar Bhaskar comes from the word

 lemon lemon and so it's a possible

 possible but and so when it's been

 possible we are thinking of course of

 the Jewish Passover when they passed

 over from the land of slavery Egypt to

 the promised land of course refer

 possible basically to when the angel

 passed over the house of the Israelites

 they were painted with the blood of the

 Lamb and they were spared and of course

 when we speak of this Passover they

 commemorated to recognize how God has

 saved them from slavery Jesus when

 history Passover he anticipated for us

 Passover for him was his return to his

 father as we are tourists in John's

 Gospel when he comes to the end of his

 life he loved us even unto death and he

 was ready to go back to his father that

 was his possible but Jesus was

 celebrated Passover also in terms of he

 himself is the Paschal bug in the

 synoptic gospel Jesus is called a cross

 over but he's in John's Gospel he is a

 part of the land that is why in st.</c>


John's Gospel Jesus died on the eve of

 the Passover on the eve itself and there

 was where the lamb was sacrifice

 in the temple at 3 p.m.</c> therefore the

 Lamb that was sacrifice and Jesus died

 on the eve because Passover know what is

 to be done and that is why they were

 anxious to remove the body of Jesus

 before the celebration of the Passover

 and so we ask ourselves how then do we

 make our own Passover

 it is very important because otherwise

 we'll be doing many things we can be and

 going through the liturgical services

 and yet not understand the meaning of

 the Passover and so what preparations

 are you making so today we are told that

 in order to make the Passover we are

 taught to be like Jesus you know we

 cannot make this Passover unless we are

 one with the Father and Jesus made the

 Passover because his whole life was to

 return to the Father his whole life was

 to glorify the Father and that is the

 reason why Jesus he has this intimacy

 with the father today in the first

 reading from the prophet Isaiah the

 suffering servant we are told that each

 morning he wakes me to hear to listen

 like a disciple the Lord has opened my

 ear Jesus was always attentive to the

 Father's will and attentive to what the

 father has seemed to do and so for us to

 to enter into a Passover it requires

 that we also pay attention to Jesus we

 too must have this intimacy of Jesus

 before we can truly enter into the

 passion with him precisely today we know

 that Judas in the gospel he was not one

 of Jesus and that is why he could not

 really celebrate the Passover with Jesus

 instead he was the one who betrayed him

 because he did not enter into his love

 and secondly we are told in order to

 go to the Passover then we need to

 surrender ourselves to the Father's will

 we need to learn to let go of the past

 we should not resist the will of God in

 our life it's this resistance of God's

 will that make us unhappy in life if you

 have been attentive to the Word of God

 this doesn't just pay attention but to

 submit the gospel again in the suffering

  servant we are told for my part I need no

  resistance neither did I turn away I offered my

 back to those who struck me my cheeks to

 those who tore at my beard there was how

 Jesus responded not we retaliation not

 with violence not be resistance but

 simply gooing according to God's will

 and that is how we live our lives you

 know it's very important therefore the

 event and the Passover we need to leave

 Egypt behind the enter the promised land

 to live our past behind our failures

 behind our brokenness our unforgiveness

 in our hearts if we don't leave them

  behind we cannot enter into the Promised Land

 and so this is where this question of

 non-resistance we just dance with the

 Lord that is very important there I

 always love that stronger this dance

 with the Lord

 dancing with the daughter is what

 actually make us happy in life if you

 know the tune then you dance of course

 for some people don't even know that you

 know how to dance

 so unless you first listen to the will

 of God then you can dance and thirdly we

 are told again that the suffering

 servant he was able to surrender himself

 to God he said the Lord comes to my help

 so them untouched by the insults who the

 Lord is coming to my help who they're

 condemned to me

 again you know to enter the Passover

 forest means we need to surrender

 ourselves to his holy will and surrender

 our lives to him oh there are many

 things in life we can understand there

 are many worries many anxieties you know

 why did this thing happen why that thing

 happened you ask me as if I know the

 answer I give answers well he knows I

 mean there are many things in life we do

 not know we don't understand what I mean

 come to the stage of my life I'm 62 you

 know or me okay love ever he will say we

 just be happy we do what we can and

 don't try to control them try to many

 play too much so long as we have done

 our best so long as we have done his

 will so be it you know because the Lord

 will surely come to our help and this is

 the surrender as Jesus did in your hands

 I commend my spirit

 it is by surrendering our lives to him

 that he will show wonders in work

 wonders we don't have to worry too much

 I think most of us have to anxious about

 our life about our future if only we

 learn to trust him then we too can enter

 into this past over and the promised

 land so you know my dear brothers and

 sisters as we come closer to the Easter

 tree diem

 let us pray that our hearts would be

 more receptive and that we are ready to

 share with Jesus and to contemplate what

 Jesus is going through because at the

 end of the day the Passover cannot be

 made the passion cannot be we can go to

 the passion unless it is done with love

 and I think is important now we start

 just going through our suffering is not

 just carrying our crosses Jesus went

 with the passion out of loved for his

 people on love

 and if we are carrying crosses in life

 we don't carry for ourselves we don't

 carry with reluctance or kill and gods

 were what to do cannot do anything open

 up and we just do it I'm not the kind of

 resentment or the kind of we do it out

 of love

 and so Jesus carried that cross not in

 what we call resentfully he carried

 wittingly because you can read for the

 love of his father and for the left of

 his home

 so that is Mingus Passover we deep love

 for God and for the love of our brothers

 and sisters and once we do that the

 cross would not be so heavy as Jesus

 says come to me all who labor and are

 burdened and I will give you rest

 shoulder my yoke and learn from me on

 gentle and humble in part
