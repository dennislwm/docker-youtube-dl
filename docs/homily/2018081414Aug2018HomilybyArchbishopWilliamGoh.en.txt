The children of today are those who are marginalised, those who are poor, those who have left the Church, those that have been hurt, those that have been wounded, and those who have lost faith in Christ and especially in the Church. Our churches are really vibrant and they are alive, but then again at the back of my mind, I am thinking of all those who have not come to church. I don't know how many young people leave after Confirmation. And there are many Catholics also in the Church, they have stopped coming because they have been wounded, disillusioned with the Church, angry with the Church, perhaps cannot accept the Church's teaching, they feel marginalised. Deep in their hearts, they want to come back to Church. They want to be reconciled with the Church. Deep in their hearts, I know they long for the Eucharist,

they long for the Sacrament of Reconciliation, but it's difficult for them to make the move,

because of the hurts that they are going through. They cannot reconcile. And so, they are staying away not because they don't love the Church, not because they don't love Christ. In fact they love Christ deeply, but the difficulty of facing the reality. There are so many challenges.

The Church is huge, that is true, but we are short of manpower, and these are the people that we should be looking after. But again,
as I say, limitations of logistics, resources,

these are the things that are holding us back. So let us pray that we'll be like Jesus, the Good Shepherd, trying to look for the little ones, the lost ones. Let us continue to ask the Lord to enlighten us and to send people who can reach out to those who are deeply wounded.
