 so the Word of God is the applications

 power of God at work in our life the

 essence of the Word of God is found in

 the Lord's Prayer if you use the Lord's

 Prayer with the context with the mind of

 Jesus then that prayer is really

 complete and that prays really and

 something of everything that we need to

 pray for please called a lost friend not

 simply because Jesus is the one who

 formulated the preference that is one

  aspect he's got the Lord's Prayer because the

 lost breath sounds up his entire life

 some salt

 his entire message that is explained in

 different ways in the gospel especially

 in the Beatitudes and so when we speak

 of the Lord's Prayer we need to enter in

 the mind and the heart of Jesus when

 Jesus is our Father in heaven

 that is clear God is our Father he has

 this deep relationship with the father

 our origin comes from the father life

 comes from the father and it is this

 relationship the father that gives us

 security if God is really your father

 then you will know he was somehow look

 after you the whole line of Jesus is

 intimacy with the father his whole

 mission begins with an encounter with

 the Father's love when he was in a

 backpack this baptism this is my beloved

 Son in whom I am well pleased there was

 the beginning of his mission discovery

 of the father's loved and then before he

 finished his ministry he was again

 doubting should he go forward you know

 to Jerusalem and then a different

 situation again the father said this is

 my beloved son and just when Jesus was

 always taking time often to the desert

 of the mountains to have this communion

 with the father he read the Saint John's

 Gospel John chapter 17 he says his whole

 life is to reveal the Father's love to

 us so that we can share in his loved

 deputies home mission his own mission is

 to proclaim the Father's love Jesus is

 me your name be held holy your kingdom

 come your will be done the whole life of

 Jesus again what is it it is to glorify

 the father that is why Jesus says me and

 namely help holding because I do your

 will so the whole life of Jesus is just

 disposed in st.</c> John's Gospel chapter 4

 John chapter 4 my food is to do the will

 of the Father

 because his will is his wisdom and in

 doing God's will his father's will he

 found this because he is identified with

 his father in thinking in feeling and

 this is what the father is the Stingers

 your will be done on earth as in heaven

 give us today our daily bread again the

 question of Jesus who life is put the

 trust in divine providence you can write

 this in Matthew we know Matthias a sick

 first the kingdom of God trust in divine

 providence forgiving that forgiveness is

 also something central to the mission of

 Jesus for life on Michigan

 of Jesus is to reconcile this with the

 father and to reconcile father means

 forgiveness forgiveness from God which

 is ours provided we also forgive one

 another so these are the things that

 actually you should reflect about do not

 put us to the test in Jesus was tested

 and say but deliver us from evil

 so we do a struggle with temptation he

 knows that it was the whole life of

 Jesus was a struggle even at the Garden

 of Gethsemane that was the final

 struggle the knots pretty soon reached

 and soon rich he sums up the whole life

 of Jesus and his son some things are so

 basically so basically said one not

 spray in one hour it can be done if you

 were to say it slowly meditating on

 every word then the Lord's Prayer he

 comes through their life and it really

 gives you strength and some sort of your

 faith amen
