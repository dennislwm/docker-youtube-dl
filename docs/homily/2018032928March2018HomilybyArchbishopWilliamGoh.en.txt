 today the scripture readings invite us

 to reflect on how we should deal with

 our enemies especially when we suffer

 betrayal in life how do we deal with

 those people who are willfully in

 destroying us and it is very interesting

 that the way Jesus dealt with his

 enemies and his betrayus his want of

 non-violence he did not retaliate Judas

 betrayal is certainly one of the most

 painful incidents in the life of Jesus

 the most painful betrayal is with people

 whom beloved so how did Jesus try to

 appeal to his enemies first and foremost

 he appeals through the question of truth

 and there is a first appeal instead of

 condemning it tries to win over his

 enemies so this is where it's important

 of a person to recognize the truth then

 he also made an appeal through love but

 Jesus our knowing that you God is

 enemy's betrayer is traitor as a last

 occult pill I give you this piece of

 bread I loved you and finally there's

 the field of mercy when I thought Jesus

 often Peter he repented so we pray today

 that we too can divide Jesus in dealing

 from enemies trying to win them over by

 truth by loved at mercy it is only our

 union with the Lord that we can go

 through the passion in life without

 union with Jesus then we cannot do what

 Jesus is doing for this let us pray
