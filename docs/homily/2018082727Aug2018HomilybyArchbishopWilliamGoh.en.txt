 is our faith mature is of being strong

 not to be stand trials and difficulties

 true faith is always measured by the

 depth of charity and compassion that you

 have for others God justice not just for

 the offense that we have committed the

 Lord judges us taking into account all

 our paths all our brokenness all our

 failings all our weaknesses and all the

 hurts that we have accumulated over the

  years be careful of using the laws in such a

 way that you'd become self righteous you

 begin to judge others without moving the

 full situation they think they observe

 the laws they are criticizing those who

 are divorce those of same-sex

 orientation and those who are having

 difficulties trying to lift up the

 commandments of God and they think they

 are very holy and they despise those

 people who break the laws but we have

 been able to try to understand them it

 is important at the end the day to ask

 ourselves whether we follow the spirit

 of the laws if the laws are applied

 blindly without understanding the

 individual the circumstances of the

 person the laws can be very harshly

 intubated whoever is an oppressor you

 must never forget he was once a victim

 we are all victims and oppressors one

 after another that is why this world is

 a want of woundedness it's easy to blame

 people when they do something wrong but

 we are also equally guilty what we need

 is to grow in love and to use the laws

 in such a way that it truly is an

 expression of love of unity and not use

 laws in such a way so that we can

 circumvent the law and feel good about

 ourselves when at the end the day we are

 cheating God because we are not living

 the spirit of love which is the

 principle behind all those
