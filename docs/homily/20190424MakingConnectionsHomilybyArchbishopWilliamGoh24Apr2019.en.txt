When we are blessed, very often we don'hink of God. We don't really appreciate what we have. It's only when things go wrong, then how come God is not so kind to us. Miracles are not proofs. Miracles will not convince everyone that it is the work of God. Experience without concept is blind. Concept without experience is empty. God will never give you an event, a religious experience without a meaning. There is a meaning. If you don't discover the meaning, then the event will just pass you by. When people go through tragedy and they cannot be healed, it'imply because they have no understanding of the tragedy.

If you understand a tragic event in your life,
the purpose, the meaning, the good that can come out of it, the lesson that you can learn from it, there is no tragedy that is a real tragedy. Every event, good or unpleasant,
can be a source of strength, a stepping stone for growth. It's only when you go through the event and you become bitter, resentful,

inward looking, you don't see the goodness that can come out of this event, you are not healed. Spend time bringing the event into prayer, going back to your life with the help of the scriptures. So it is in the scriptures that the answer is found. You need to make time to pray the scriptures. At the end of the day, you must just go through very quickly,

what are those big or small events and ask yourself, what have I learnt? What should I be grateful to God for? What should I thank God for? Whom should I be praying for? What should I be praying for? And that is how we grow in our spiritual life.
