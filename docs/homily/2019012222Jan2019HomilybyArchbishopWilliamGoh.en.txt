When we try to do good, we can be misunderstood.
And instead of being grateful for what we have done, the efforts that we have put in,
we find ourselves wrongly ridiculed and criticised.

In the face of trials and difficulties, we give up hope. We have forgotten why we started in the first place. We have forgotten the hope before us. And it's important that we continue to refresh that hope. Never give up on hope, the hope for our greater future.

And that is what faith is all about - not to give up, even though sometimes we see things are not changing. With faith in Christ, we know that somehow, things will happen. And don't worry, it might not even happen in your lifetime, but we do not know the seeds that we have sown. It will reap sooner or later.
But what is important is we have done our part, we have given hope. And I believe that we must keep on giving hope to people, even though sometimes we feel so hopeless. And this is where faith comes in. Without faith,

we cannot sustain that hope. Keep on believing because a time will come. As the saying goes,

when the student is ready, the master will appear. So let us pray that God will renew our hope.
