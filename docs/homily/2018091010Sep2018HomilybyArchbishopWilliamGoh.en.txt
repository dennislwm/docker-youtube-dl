Today, the scripture readings instruct us on how we should deal with sinners in a Christian community. We must be careful because we need to balance the question of discipline with the compassion of Jesus. we must avoid falling into legalism, into self-righteousness. In our judgment, the most important principle in considering how we should handle a sinner is whether whatever we do, is it for the good of the person; the ultimate good. To save the sinner, not to destroy the sinner. That's the first principle. The second principle that flows from this is whether the sin that is committed, is it of such a great scandal to the community that if unchecked, the community could be threatened. The Church asks us to exercise compassion. When we think of sinners in the community, at the back of our mind we have to ask the Lord how to apply the principles. Application requires a discerning spirit. Every case is different. Is it the best thing to excommunicate a member? Maybe, maybe not.

if you tell them that they are condemned, they will leave the Church. We need to include them.

We need to try to save them. We need to make them to feel that they are loved instead of marginalising them, instead of condemning them. We must love them even more. Show them the love of Christ and let the Lord Jesus reach out to them. So let us pray for this gift of discernment.
