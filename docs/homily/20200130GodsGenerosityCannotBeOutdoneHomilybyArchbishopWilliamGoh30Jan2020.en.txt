Like King David, all of us too have been blessed by God in different ways. God has given us different blessings. The blessings that He has given to us, therefore, are not meant for ourselves. When God gives us blessings,
we are to be accountable for the blessings we have received. We cannot be ungrateful and take them for granted. So if God has given us blessings in life, then we must use the blessings we receive, never for ourselves only, but always for the service of humanity,
for the service of the Church, for the service of others. When we keep blessings to ourselves,
then we have been unfaithful to God's generosity.

And so this is where we are reminded of the need to continue to be generous with what we have. There is also the accountability of developing what the Lord has given to us.

Sometimes gifts have been given but we have forgotten them. When the Lord has blessed us with gifts, if we don't use them, we will lose them. And it is only in the exercise of the gifts that we become better and better each day. So it is very important, therefore,

today that we be responsible. And if we are responsible to God, then God will be responsible to us. So let us pray that we will be faithful to what we have received, so that we can truly be the dwelling place of God for all. And people can see the presence of God in and through the gifts that we have.
