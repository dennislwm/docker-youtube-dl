 we want to focus on the themed of power

 and authority we need to examine

 ourselves how we use our power our use

 our authority there is always this

 temptation that we can use Authority and

 power to use it for our own personal

 interests and not for the service of

 others Authority is a gift therefore we

 are called to use it well we are called

 to be stewards stewards of God's

 authority so is how we use our authority

 for the service of others most of all

 authority and power must be used for the

 poor the marginalized to empower those

 who are powerless to give strength to

 those who are weak to help people to

 grow and this is mostly true of women

 and of the elderly when we exercise

 authority it must always be in the mind

 of God those in authority therefore must

 be people who pray people who are in

 touch with God because the moment when

 we are not in touch with God we begin to

 depend too much on yourself instead of

 relying on the Word of God and so this

 is where those in power we need to pray

 we need to discern whether we are making

 use of the authority properly also if we

 want to appreciate authority not only we

 must be people in connection with God we

 must be people who are grateful for the

 gift if we are not grateful we take this

 Authority the power that God has

 investors for granted then we begin to

 abuse once we are stupid our office we

 are the same we are no different from

  others were responding to equality when all of

 us with the Lord evening
