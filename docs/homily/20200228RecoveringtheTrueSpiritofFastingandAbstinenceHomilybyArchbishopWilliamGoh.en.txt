  so my dear brothers and sisters in price  today being the Friday after Ash  Wednesday the team is of course on  fasting and financed because  traditionally every Friday is the day  when Catholics do penance and so it is  important for us in today'cripture  readings to remind us of the spirit of  penance that we should be doing it is  not just enough to practice penance but  most of all to recover the spirit of how  this penance should be done or else we  will be condemned as the prophet Isaiah  condemned his people because they were  fasting and yet they were wreaking the  loss of God so that was what Isaiah said  to them this kind of fasting would never  make your voice heard on high so what  kind of fasting should we do in order  that he can truly please God and help  ourselves so the most important reason  for fasting or the real reason for  fasting for as Catholics is the  spiritual reason so we fast so that we  can grow closer to God  fasting happens to again for the  presence of God when we are deprived of  something we begin to yin for something  that is absent so fasting happens not to  take what we have for granted in life  and this is true even for  the celebration of the Eucharist and the  reception of the Eucharist until this  coronavirus happened every Sunday every  weekday you can attend Mass you can  receive the Eucharist but not many  Catholics attend now it is taken away  now you feel the absence of  the Eucharist then you begin to value the  communion that you receive so even in  this situation when we have been  deprived of our spiritual goods God uses  it uch our lives and to help us to  gain even more for him that is why on  Good Friday  there is no celebration Eucharist  because Good Friday is to help us to  enter into the Passion of Jesus so that  we can rejoice with him on Holy Saturday  at the Easter Vigil so fasting is really  to help us to become more United with  God that is the spiritual motif of  fasting that is why Jesus said surely  the Breton's attendant would never think  of mourning as long as a bridegroom we  still give them the time to come for the  bridegroom to be taken away from them  then they will fast  the second spiritual reason for fasting  is for spiritual self disciplined not  just self discipline some people fast  because they want to discipline  themselves so that they can achieve  success in life I study hard I play my  music I can focus that is not the  purpose of fasting of course fasting  helps a person to exercise  self-discipline but the discipline we  are concerned about is spiritual  discipline that is to say that we can  resist temptations we can control our  anger we can control our desires because  if you cannot even control your desires  you can even control your temper how can  you control the  how can you master your body if you  cannot even master your spirit so that  is very important so that's why today  when we fast it is in order for us to  have the strength to resist the temptations of the evil one  to be able to resist sins of course the  fasting is not just only spiritual  discipline it also helps us to be more  sensitive to the sufferings of others so  we deprive ourselves of food so that  we begin to value and to cherish what  we received in life even for the food we  have so most of us we take our food for  granted but on Friday when you have  hungry even polished tastes excellent  just with a few it can be list and plane  polished it tastes so delicious it's  because we learn to feel with the  sufferings of others so in the final  analysis it is important to realize this  fasting doing penance they are meant to  help us to cultivate a deeper love for  God a deeper love for brothers and  sisters and to exercise self-control  unfortunately many of us even Catholics especially because we are so used to  remember bring that Friday is a day of  penance and so many of us we perform the  penance in a very legalistic way so  Friday  I don't eat mean and I feel that I have  done the penance so this legalistic way  of doing penance will not change our  lives of course there are some of us who  fast you know on bread and water not  just on Friday maybe two or three times  a week so they can boast to people you  I'm such a disciplined person I can fast  we breath in water three times a week   fasting and doing penance is for  vanity it will not help us in fact it  destroys us even more  that is why Jesus warns us when you  first make sure that people do not know  that you are fasting and more  importantly some of us again we fast for  therapeutic reasons because you want  to look slim and beautiful when it comes to  slimming we can faster the lid when you  ask the FASFA jesus or astronauts they  good friends or difficult but you know  if for ladies to lose weight for men  even men also want to lose weight today  not just ladies men also ask them to  fast no problem and that is why some of  them are suffering in front for anorexia  and bulimia so it's the wrong reason for  fasting so the church tries to overcome  these wrong intention in the way people  practice fasting abstinence so the  church changed the law until recently  all Catholics must fast and abstain to  those above the age of fourteen must  fast and abstain from meat on Good  Friday Ash Wednesday and all Fridays of  the year  we must abstain from meat now the  universal Church has even the bishops  conference the authority to substitute  on Friday instead of abstinence from me  you can substitute with works of piety  we press works of charity  except for Ash Wednesday and Good Friday  we still have to fast abstain from me  other Fridays you can substitute that is  where the Bishops Conference has been  given that power for the own caffeine so  that  hopefully our Catholics will practice  this penance with great sincerity and  with greater meaning because you know in  Singapore some of us love to eat seafood  and so Friday becomes a day of  celebration it's not their finance you  know and so if you are enjoying yourself  you cannot say legally you have done  your penance  but in spirit you have not so what's the  situation now unfortunately this policy  or this discipline also backfires  because we have removed compulsory  abstinence from meat on Friday now every  Catholic in the Bishops Conference here  Malaysia Singapore given the choice to  either abstain from me or do some other  forms of penance because a common  penance now is not imposed most of our  Catholics now even forget to do penance  they continue to eat meat but they stop  doing penance altogether so what is the  situation what does it show the law  cannot change people the law cannot  change heart it is a sincerity of each  individual understanding the importance  the value of fasting abstinence doing  penance unless a person really wants to  grow in you name the Lord to grow in  South discipline so that he can truly  control his own life and be able to  reach out to others in love in service  no laws can truly change our hearts so  let us pray for true sincerity of a humble and contrite heart
