 so the question of the Resurrection

 today appears in the gospel the

 resurrection is not the resuscitation it

 is not the same body the same body being

 resurrected yes

 the same matter yes when we rise again

 we will have a transmitted body this

 first level of the resurrection now the

 second level resurrection is the we

 entering the communion of saints and I

 think is very important the community of

 sins when we die again we will be able

 to see God face to face

 and our love will be like God and God

 you know God loves every one of us

 individually and personally as well

 anyway whatever it is God loved your to

 the capacity that you can extend that

 love our love on this cell is a very

 very self-centered in exclusive loved

 but when you have come to the stage

 where you learn to love all that you

 learn to let go that's why a priest is

 precisely is invited to have that

 celibate love is precisely to love

 everyone and to already a priestly life

 religious that is supposed to be a

 foretaste of the kingdom that is to come

 so that he's supposed to love everyone

 freely and that's why he's the father of

 the whole family and everyone is

 important to him so a priest is invited

 to luck in that way so that when he dies

 that is already a big hall his forties

 and everybody in that sense we are

 called to go beyond ourselves even for

 those of you who have families yes you

 should love your families that is the

 most important but if your love is

 confined to your family or name you're

 going to be very disappointed because

 you're not must pulled up from your

 family it must go up to others as far as

  possible and this is where the love grows and

 then they love that when the family

 members are pouring out that love to

 other people to society and that love

 among yourselves will also grow it is

 true for all of us we need to offend a

 spirit of love in our hearts we need to

 awaken that love so that we be ready to

 bring that love to others and most of

 all as simple says you know when we are

 filled with the Spirit of God which is a

 spirit of loved then we will not be

 ashamed to bear witness to the law to

 bear hot sheets because of what he has

 done for us so for me at the end of the

 day the only way we can love more

 inclusively is when we feel the love of

 God when we are like st.</c> Paul he said

 you know relying on the power of God

 were saved us and called us to be holy

 not because of anything we ourselves

 have done but for His grace because of

 His grace

 when we have that then we'll be able to

 live that kind of life so that's why we

 should be thankful to God and we need to

 learn to reach out to each other vision

 to my love picking up and there is love

 grow and it's all love is strengthened

 then we could also lead reach out to

 others other groups as well and then to

 your family and then moved up because

 for me is very very often you need to

 find love somewhere you need to

 experience that kind of unconditional

 love and you can go up otherwise you're

 going to carry your bitterness with you

 to the display that you know for

 ourselves we try to leave heaven on

 earth and heaven
