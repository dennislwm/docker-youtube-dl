 your Excellencies once he knows their

 fathers brothers and sisters in Christ

 this evening as we get it here for this

 celebration of the restoration of this

 challenge we like an Israelite into this

 this reading also I in tears why were

 they in tears simply because they could

 not believe that the core a worship

 could be so faithful to his word and God

 told them that he will restore the ring

 walls of Israel and how did he do it it

 was almost unthinkable that go inspire

 King Cyrus who was a pagan King to send

 nehemia the governor to Israel to

 restore the ring walls and not only that

 this King even provided financial help

 and logistic support and that is why

 when they thought of the mercy the

 fidelity of God something they thought

 was impossible and it happened they were

 in tears my dear brothers and sisters in

 many ways we are in tears because the

 cathedral the mother church of the

 Catholic Archdiocese in Singapore is

 like an elderly mother you know today

 those of you who are parents you will

 understand when you get older all your

 children will leave to you and some even

 migrate you'd be left at home and the

 mother church is something like that the

 mother gives birth to many children and

 where the children they are all over

 singapore inner parishes and so the

 cathedral although the mother church has

 a mother without children staying here

 that is why the cathedral has become

 more a church for visitors for tourists

 and for this reason cathedral is one of

 the poorest church in singapore because

 we don't have bearish honest and

 therefore we don't have the funds and

 that is why to restore this church was

 really a daunting task mr.</c> limbo hain no

 he must have prayed very hard where to

 get the money and the money came from

 rich and poor alike but most of the

 money actually came from the reserves of

 the parishes the parish priests were

 extremely sympathetic the rest and a few

 big benefactors but of course

 money is not everything we need the

 logistic support we need people the

 experts to help us restore disk

 cathedral and many offered their

 services generously and freely and that

 is why we are truly grateful to god

 because we never thought that there

 could be so many people who would hear

 the cry of the mother church but my dear

 brothers and sisters even as we rejoice

 that this church is now restored to his

 magnificence yet the cathedral is not a

 museum the cathedral is not a building

 the cathedral exists in order to bring

 lived you can have the most beautiful

 cathedral if it's just only a museum he

 will not change lives that is why the

 cathedral just like a church the second

 reading houses is an assembly of God's

 people we are called to be the household

 of God and simple makes it clear you are

 no longer aliens or foreign visitors you

 are citizens like all the sins all of us

 therefore our members of the household

 of God at the very beginning of the

 service we sing that beautiful him

 everyone is welcome all

 welcome the church does not belong to

 the bishop lot of the priests it belongs

 to everyone and that is what is so

 important for us as Church we must

 always never forget church must always

 be inclusive of everyone reach for

 languages cultures and that but is that

 is what it means to be Catholic

 Universal no boundaries the church is

 the family of God as we have sang just

 now God is the father of all regardless

 whether they are believers are

 non-believers and so my dear brothers

 and sisters essentially the church

 exists first and foremost for the

 members the church is manda is called to

 give live do not sure the children and

 so we have a story in today's first

 reading he was proclaiming the Word of

 God explaining the meaning of the word

 so that the people could apply to their

 lives and that is what the judge does we

 continue to nurture and strengthen the

 faith of our members through the

 proclamation the word and to the

 celebration of the sacraments we're all

 will encounter Jesus in a very real way but this is not for the members alone

 the church always exists but for holy

 people the church exists for sinners

 that's why today gospel is very

 important because we are told Jesus in

 his ministry he was always welcoming

 sinners prostitutes max collectors and

 everyone else the church is not just

 only for people who are holy it is men

 for people who are weak and that is why

 the church must include

 the church must also include those who

 are divorced those who same-sex

 orientation even because they are

 members of God's family no matter how

 great a sinner a person least they must

 be welcome no one must behave like the

 Pharisees and the scribes today

 complaining that Jesus and the sinners

 host because jesus said this men too is

 a son of Abraham but the Son of man has

 come to seek out and save what was lost we must learn to be humble that s

 Catholics even as we grow in faith we

 must be sure that we are not judgmental

 self-righteous and thinking that we are

 better than others because we are

 essentially with people and assonance

 ourselves in oh my dear brothers and

 sisters the church not only exists or

 saints or sinners are principally also

 the church we know is a house of prayer

 and that is what Jesus in the gospel he

 made it clear it must be a place of

 Prayer a place of worship but we can

 have the most beautiful liturgy as we

 have this evening the best greatest

 singing participation but the whole

 purpose of worship is to lead us to a

 life of charity that's why the church

 exists not just for sinners exist what

 the poor today's first reading is very

 telling we are told after the worship

 what did Ezra tell the people go eat the

 bring the sweet wine and send a portion

 to the man who has nothing prepared

 reading a Catholic who comes to worship

 but does not share what he has with

 others then the whole meaning of worship

 is defeated let's why the sacramental

 you crease that we celebrate which is

 the giving of Christ's body and soul to

 rest is an invitation that we should die

 with Jesus and to give our lives for the

 service of policy so it's not enough to

 pray it's not enough to worship the

 fruit of worship is singing charity and

 the church cannot do without charity

 good works are the signs that we are

 walking the way of the Lord and this

 charity extends particularly to the poor

 the sick the cementation that is why we

 purposely put a statue in case you do

 not know there's a statue of the

 homeless Jesus he's outside they're

 lying at the bench again say hello to

 him after them he put him there to

 remind this Cathedral one of the

 landmarks will be that the sky deidre

 will be no not just the mother of urine

 but mother of those who are bending

 those who are poor and there is why

 Mancino hang every Sunday make sure that

 we give some food served a lunch to the

 poor and we even have a fun year

 reserved only for the poor otherwise we

 cannot look in the gospel without x

 any church if the church is really a

 church of christ charity is the hallmark but when you speak of the poor let me

 tell you please don't think the poor are

 those who are just materially /</c> yes the

 other ones those who are sick today in

 Singapore we have many rich people after

 weren't successful people the anti real

 pool that is what sin Teresa of Calcutta

 tells us this you know the rich for are

 the most difficult to reach because why

 they have everything they want but they

 are poor how do you know your work if

 you are rich and successful how do you

 know your poor when you find there is

 the vacuum in your life when you find

 that life is not meaningful when you do

 not know what you're leaving for when

 you're just going to live you're making

 tons of money in your business yes is

 true you're being promoted you're

 successful in a career but let me ask

 you are you at peace do you find like a

 great draw every morning when you wake

 up do you look forward to living if you

 go to work if you can do your business

 and you feel it's a choice a burden then

 you are not living life that is why what

 does the church offer to those who are

 reached we offer them meaning purposed

 when you have meaning when you have

 purpose in life and life is reached

 every morning every day and i can tell

 you these many brothers and sisters i

 speak on my own behalf if I'm passionate

 about what I'm doing is simply because

 my office

 I wrestled this mean the opportunity to

 enrich the lives of people to enlighten

 people to give them hope to give them

 Jesus and the greatest thing we can give

 to our brothers and sisters is always

 false and that is the that is what

 actually makes my life meaningful when

 you are giving life to people you are

 not worried about your needs we tell you

 honestly those who people reached let me

 tell you honestly do those of your

 parenting the rich people are very happy

 day and know what you know how much food

 can they eat is let me ask you rich

 people don't eat much in fact that it

 less than you because are the affair or

 high cholesterol and not getting too fat

 even for me as the bishop I can tell you

 don't think that I'm starving to death

 you know if I want to eat every night

 people invite me out but I cannot eat

 too much after that I will you have to

 pay my medical bills so even for myself

 and make sure I don't eat too much other

 discipline myself you don't have to be

 so slick move I have to take care of my

 health why because I loved you I do want

 you to pay my medical bills and I want

 to serve you I don't want you to serve

 me we serve together yes but it's not

 for you to serve me I'm here to serve

 you and together we circle yes and the

 people of God so those who are reached

 you can have plenty of money but i can

 tell you their food is very simple a how

 many base you need to sleep on one bed

 how many cars you need one car when you

 have a certain amount of money listen

 you got five million dollars in a bang

 or 10 million you're ready 70 years old

 how much more money do we need to you

 want to buy a coffin that costs four

 million dollar

 you don't need that how do you do with

 the money they're just numbers a

 personal God hundred million dollars

 every think the person can spend hundred

 million dollars in his life impossible

 what you do your children will spend it

 for you thank you but it is not the best

 thing we do for our children as well so

 you know my dear brothers and sisters

 this is where I think it is important as

 we gather here this evening we want to

 praise and thank God and we want to make

 the cathedral I hope every parish in

 Singapore would be in the same direction

 that is why you notice in this path days

 of celebration beginning this evening

 every night is devoted to a special

 topic we have one night for the young

 people one night the family one life for

 the social mission of the church one

 line for the sea and five nights for all

 the district and for the other groups in

 order to help us remember that this is

 an inclusive church the mother church

 belongs to all and today as we read the

 first reading again when they heard the

 Word of God we are told the people they

 bow down in face of the ground

 prostrated themselves before the Lord we

 do we have heard the Word of God so let

 us put into practice let us remember JK

 is a very beautiful symbol of a rich

 person trying to find meaning in life

 there are many jackets here they are

 rich life is meaningless and when you

 find a lot let me tell you you find that

 your life will be full of joy or indeed

 astre said do not be said the joy of the

 Lord is your strong pole
