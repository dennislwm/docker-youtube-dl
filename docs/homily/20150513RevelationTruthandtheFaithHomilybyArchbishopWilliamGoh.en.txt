 followers are seeking for God in our

 lives regardless of who we are even

 those who do not explicitly believe in

 God so long as we are searching for the

 food 'no sup life for meaning or purpose

 for lasting loved then we are certainly

 searching for God of course for many

 people they do not know who God is and

 so like the men of Athens we are -</c> they

 have many monuments to express the

 desire to worship this true God they

 even had an author as simple said to an

 unknown God

 so the question therefore that is a

 suppose this morning is where can we

 find this God where we can find the

 Living God and what does it mean to find

 the Living God to find that Living God

 is ultimately to find the ultimate truth

 reality of life something that can truly

 fulfill us satisfy us and quench our

 thirst and a hunger to worship false

 gods to worship idols is precisely to

 worship things that cannot last thus far

 those of us who have pursuits only of

 this life can never find happiness money

 status power pleasures all these do not

 last so what is lasting in life

 ultimately is loved and truth and that

 is what we hoped and so for this reason

 to worship idols is really to worship

 nothing that's why the sin of idolatry

 is really to worship and illusion

 because it is not real all these things

 are passing and they are transient

 so to find fulness of life we need to

 look for things that can truly last and

 for this reason in order to find a

 Living God we can move find him

 provided God reduce himself to rest we

 will never know who God is unless he

 shares his life with us it is for this

 reason that Christianity is considered a

 revealed religion it is taught by a

 quest and reason alone that you come to

 not live in God it is purely through

 faith and true taste unless God reviews

 in software's his inner life we would

 never know who caucused just says he

 will never know who your friend is until

 your friend chooses to reveal his or her

 feelings about himself or herself

 this is true love God for this reason

 also we can understand and appreciate

 that for those people who have not

 received the revelation they try to

 create God out of their images and that

 is why the game in today's first reading

 we are told that they make statues and

 all the different forms of expression to

 try to express their deepest desire so I

 believe others or even have statues

 which have a religion you go to these

 are tends to

 press the desire for the transcendence

 because they have not received a

 revelation they can only create out of

 what we call the Avengers that they have

 on this earth and that's the reason why

 simple makes it clear to them when we

 told them precisely that we have no

 excuse for thinking that the deity looks

 like anything in gold silver or stone

 that has been carved and designed by

 meant because of this we therefore

 cannot blame those who have not found

 God we cannot blame those therefore who

 do not know him because at the end the

 day it is a question of faith and

 revelation what these people who do not know God

 they have ignorant at the same time they

 are searching for the fullness of truth for is Christine if we are so certain of

 who the Living God

 Easter it is precisely because of the

 life the death the resurrection the

 Ascension of Jesus because Jesus in his

 whole life he showed us the farthest

 left and mercy a movie botany the love

 of Jesus expressed in his depth but of

 course Kristin T not only believed that

 Jesus light the greater thing about a

 Christian is to believe that Jesus rose

 it is the resurrection of Jesus

 therefore that vindicates all his claims

 of who he was that he was one with the

 father so it is a basis the resurrection

 that we are clear and certain that Jesus

 is not Jesus the expression of God but

 here is the son of God and not only that

 he is a son of God because in today's

 Gospel he spoke about the Holy Spirit

 whom the father was sent in his thing

 without Jesus we will never know that

 God is in Taylor

 so that also requires repetition so when

 people disagree with us about the

 Christian understanding of God as the

 Holy Trinity we should not be angry or

 we should not even feel that we are

 aggrieved because they don't have the

 revelation by using reason alone if they

 never arrived at least so for is our

 certainty displaced on the resurrection

 a horde but having said that I must also

 add this because we are certain that

 Jesus is our Lord and Savior it is good

 to understand that we even as Catholics

 have not fully grasp even our fate that

 is why Jesus said to his disciples I

 still have many things to say to you but

 they would be too much for you now our

 the spirit through comes he will lead

 you to the conflict truth so even as

 Catholics we believe Jesus a fullness of

 Revelation and beyond Jesus there is

 nothing more all that needed to be

 revealed has been revealed in Christ

 Jesus but it does not mean to say that

 we have fully so to speak explore the

 truths that are contained in Jesus so

 even for us as Catholics revelation is

 completed with the death and

 resurrection of Christ but the

 understanding of this revelation needs

 to grow as we continue to reflect on the

 words the realities and the life of

 Christ so on one hand the church says

 revelation is completely on the other

 hand revelation is also ongoing that we

 begin to reflect deeper and deeper and

 we our faith therefore can grow that is

 why in the Catholic Church we speak for

 the development of doctrines doctrines

 can develop from something that is basic

 to something that is Richard so faith is

 something like that you have not arrived

 yet we are still growing and that is the

 fact of life there are many things that

 actually happens in our lives we don't

 really understand the point of time our

 understanding is limited that is why all

 of us are born with the gift of

 hindsight that's the gift given to all

 of us and the gif of hindsight and your

 hindsight gets clearer over the years

 that is the truth you experience a

 problem of failure if you were to

 understand it one year ago 10 years from

 now 20 years from now your understanding

 would be so different because as we grow

 older we have a fuller picture that is

 why in order to understand things we

 need to distance ourselves a how much

 can we distant emotionally distant it's

 only over time as when we become more

 mature and also because of new

 situations we look at things differently

 so that's why as they said you know

 actually we never see things as they are

 we see things as we have that is so

 interpretation is never objective it is

 subjective and so this is where today

 when we celebrate the mass and

 preparation for the Feast of Ascension

 tomorrow Jesus speaks of the need for

 the Spirit of Truth who believers in the

 fullness of truth only the spirit can

 therefore convict us and review Turris

 who Jesus is and who the father is and

 so as we are the eve of this ascension

 the church asks us to pray to the Holy

 Spirit the Holy Spirit that lead us into

 complete truth so -</c> fight from tomorrow

 on with the church will ask us to begin

 the novena up to the Holy Spirit

 davina the Holy Spirit because only the

 spirit and relieve lead us to the

 fullness of life and left

 and for this reason we need to pray for

 this reason we need to really understand

 the Word of God so that we could really

 with all this life aiming
