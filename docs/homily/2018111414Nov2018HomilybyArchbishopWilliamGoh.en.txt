 we are caught to be examples to others

 in society as Christians and we do it

 not because we want to be special not

 because we have a separately complex the

 only motive for us to live a good

 Christian life simply because of what

 the Lord has done for us so if we live a

 good life it is because out of gratitude

 out of love for the fact that we have

 been loved unconditionally so it's a

 response to God's mercy and love that we

 are living a good life not because we

 are better than others if the Lord heals

 you if the lot GOC of you Eunice you're

 supposed now to use your life for the

 service of others God has extended your

 life so that you may have a chance to be

 an instrument of his loving mercy at the

 same time to heal yourself deeply of

 your imperfections they will grow in

 love in generosity every day we are life

 it is a great blessing that means God

 wants to want to use us and wants us to

 use ourselves for his love for his

 service that is how we lived that is how

 life becomes meaningful it is by living

 out this kind of life then we are truly

 saved in entire body mind soul and

 spirit amen
