 what is freedom freedom is not simply

 the faculty to choose that is not

 freedom freedom means the ability to

 determine what is always good for me and

 good for others freedom is not so much

 the ability to choose between good and

 evil this is a very important

 consideration because if you choose good

 and evil it needs to say therefore you

 can choose that but to choose good all

 the time is really an exercise of

 freedom the ability to determine

 yourself to become the person that God

 meant for you to be when you choose

 either it shows you that freedom because

 evil is against your good against the

 common good every human person must

 always desire good no one desires evil

 no one desires death all of us desire

 life so the person who is without the

 wisdom of God in ignorance he chooses

 theft and so this is very important for

 us believers in God although we are

 subject to a higher principle it does

 not mean they are not free in fact we

 are so free that we always choose what

 is good and what is right the laws of

 God are not meant to restrain us to make

 our life miserable the laws of God are

 meant to help us to live an authentic

 life of freedom or original sin is to

 say now we share this ended nature of

 office parents although now we know what

 is right what is wrong we still choose

 what is wrong because of ignorance

 because of pride because of disobedience

 because we are not really fully

 enlightened as to the evil of what what

 is original sin means that we are born

 with this lack of capacity to choose

 when the Spirit of Christ can change our

 mind and do us that's why unless we are

 really invite a spirit then our human

 spirit world rulers and how can they

 receive the Spirit of Christ precisely

 to the Word of God to the sacrum the new

 clay Saucon reconciliation through

 prayers is all this means by which the

 more and more we receive the spirit of

 Jesus then more and more we find a

 strength to overcome evil in our lives
