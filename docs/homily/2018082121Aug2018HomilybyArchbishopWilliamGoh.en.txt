When we are successful in life, when everything is going on our way, we tend to think too much of ourselves, tend to lack humility and trust and reliance on God. Trusting in divine providence is what actually will help us to be true and to find life. At the end of the day, we must always bear in mind that wealth and riches, they are just means to happiness.
You measure your life not by how much money you have. You can have plenty of money and yet miserable. Wealth is to live a life that is full, a life that is of meaning, a life that is with good relationship, a life that is purposeful, you are healthy. These are the real wealth of life, and sometimes very often we forget and we think that wealth is all about money. And so this is where we have to really recognise that God's blessings comes to us in many different ways.
It's not just money, it's not just wealth.

To have people around you, to have good friends, that's what life is all about.
