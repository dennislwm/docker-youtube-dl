 and so it is true for all of us if we

 look at ourselves our hearts are

 troubled in many ways most of us are

 troubled we'd like peace in our lives

 most of the time because of the past

 very seldom it is the present that

 troubles us it is always the past in the

 future it is a past that reverses the

 mistakes that we have made the sins we

 are committed and most of the time I

 always feel that we cannot moved on

 because it is very difficult to forgive

 the mistakes that we have made

 especially for those of us who are older

 those of us who are parents sometimes we

 look back our lives and then we wonder

 we could have done better we could have

 raised our children up differently and

 so sometimes we live in regrets perhaps

 there is something that we said and have

 had someone and the relationship has

 been broken and so we find difficult to

 forgive ourselves especially when we see

 the full repercussions most parents feel

 that if they had not done this with your

 children if they have not abused them if

 they had been more patient if they have

 been less Emperor the truth today would

 not become so rebellious so full of

  anger always fighting back because we know

 very well that very often the children

 take after the parents and so we live

 with lots of regrets we wish that

 something we should not have done that

 it could be undone but the truth is

 we cannot undo what we have done and so

 this is where the question of whether we

 can forgive ourselves and especially

 when we see the situation being unfolded

 whether we can accept the consequences

 of our actions the destroy most of us

 when we look not just the past you look

 at the present and know what is

 happening in our children then we feel

 troubled of course some of us are

 troubled because of the future we look

 at the trends Nouveau today trends in

 society trends in our children young

 people those of you who are parents you

 know hmm sometimes you just wonder what

 is the future for your children the

 world is very difficult to live in today

 it is so messy and it is so confusing

 and so you wonder where is the world

 going and moving what directions can be

 gift in time to come we cannot even tell

 our children what to do because they are

 so influenced by the internet so you

 have these people to form them and so

 what we do do we just focus on our

 problems and our worries our fears

 rather we are calling to this gospel

 just to focus on Jesus that is why Jesus

 said trust in God and trans in me Trust

 is what will help us to move on in life

 if we keep focusing on our problems and

 our issues and our past we will be

 crippled will be paralyzed we lose joy

 of living and so it is to trust in God

 that somehow God is in charge and there

 somehow God is in control and we cannot

 do this unless we have our view

 Bishop with the daughter trust is always

 dependent a relationship is just like

 trusting someone trusting our parents if

 there is no relationship there is no

 trust when there is a lack of

 relationship trust would be lacking

 suspicions will develop so relationship

 needs time because it builds trust and

 so when Jesus said into this gospel

 there are many rooms in my father's

 house I'm going to prepare a place for

 you don't think it is going up there to

 prepare place but Jesus says I'm many

 rooms in my father's house to say room

 is what room is not a space simple tell

 the people make room for me in your

 heart and means give me a space in your

 heart the room is not so much a special

 thing a room is having space for someone

 making time for someone that is what to

 make a room and so Jesus is telling us

 you know I'm going to prepare your place

 what is this place this is not up there

 not down there anywhere the place is

 that you will have a place in the heart

 of the Father that the father has room

 for you that is what Jesus is saying

 that is what happened heaven is not

 going anywhere

 please anywhere in heaven heaven is just

 to be in the heart of the Father and so

 when Jesus says I'm going to prepare you

 a place I shall return to take you with

 me so that where I am you may be too

 what is this place what is it gonna take

 us he's not gonna pick us he is going he

 after his death and resurrection he has

 gone back to the Father to be the father

 and he has shown us the way not to go to

 the Father he has shown us the way how

 to be with the father he has shown us

 the way how to lock the father that is

 what it means I am the way that so when

 Thomas asked Jesus Lord we do not know

 where you are going how can we know the

  way I'm the way the truth and the life no

 one can come to the Father except to me

 so Jesus is showing us the way you do

 know the father so when they say Jesus

 is the way the truth in the way doesn't

 mean said all those people who are not

 Catholic they go to hello they are just

 saying that if you want to know the

 fullness of the Father's love

 you must come to Jesus because as we

 have seen in the first reading the

 scripture says fulfillment of Jesus as

 the Messiah you are my son today I

 become your father we are come here to

 tell the good news and this good news is

 promised to our ancestors to our

 children and he has fulfilled it but

 there is increases from the day so in

 his passion death and resurrection Jesus

 has shown us the father that is what it

 means if you want to know the fullness

 of the Father's love you come to Jesus

 because Jesus is Son of God Jesus washed

 away and Jesus opens the way for us if

 we follow the path of Jesus and to do

 follow the path of Jesus and notice it

 we we are tourists and shall return to

 take you with me how he is not going

 there and then coming back and bring us

 up there no he's the actual I'm going

 there and I return return is the return

 is the Holy Spirit so he comes back in

 the Holy Spirit and praise the Holy

 Spirit he dwells in you so when you have

 the Holy Spirit you have the Father's

 love the design Romans 5:5 the love of

 God is pouring to our hearts in the Holy

 Spirit so we are going nowhere

 not anywhere even is in your heart so if

 you had the Holy Spirit that is heavenly

 and the Holy Spirit is the love of God

 that is what gives security that is what

 gives us joy and of course when it comes

 to death then it's the fullness of the

 indwelling of the Holy Spirit because in

 complete union with God so already in

 this life so long as we have the Holy

 Spirit in us and that's what Jesus

 to bring to us Jesus is bringing happen

 to us when we give us the Holy Spirit

 amen
