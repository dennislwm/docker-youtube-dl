  today we enter the season of Holy Week  the most holiest days of the churches  here on this Palm Sunday the Lord  invites us to enter into Jerusalem with  him to join him this journey to  share in his suffering so that we can share in  his glory my dear brothers and sisters  in order for us to prepare ourselves  well for this journey the Liturgy of  Palm Sunday gives us a preview of what  is to come we have the benefit of  the hindsight of what the Jews and the  disciples during the time of Jesus went  through so that we do not have to make the same mistakes all over again  indeed my dear brothers and sisters the  church wants us to reflect on this  events so that we can truly imitate his  life if we have observed and pay  attention to the readings of the  description text you will find that at  this moment in Jerusalem during the time of Jesus  Jerusalem was filled with thousands of  pilgrims coming to celebrate the Feast  of the Passover the people were all  excited and also  many of them have heard rumors about  Jesus who multiply bread to feed 5000  and even raise Lazarus from the dead so  we can imagine the excitement of the  people of the person Jesus but these  also cause consternation and fear to the  authorities both the religious and  political authorities for they fear that  the rebalance a revolution might take  place because they were all talking  about Jesus and the situation was made  even more precarious as we have read the  gospel at the very beginning of this  mass when Jesus entered into Jerusalem  in triumphant manner and yet in a lowly  manner he went into Jerusalem seated on  a donkey and a cult symbols of his  Messiah shift because as we have read in  the prophecies that the Messiah will  enter into Jerusalem on a cold and a  donkey Jesus came as the king of beasts  in all lowliness not on a host where  warriors would sit on because they came  to conquer the world through power  through might Jesus came as a king of  Peace in humility and we have the  response of the people that when he  entered Jerusalem  the people were saying Hosanna to the  son of David blessed is he who comes in  the name of the Lord hosanna in the  highest  in welcoming Jesus they understood the  political undertones of proclaiming  Jesus as the Messiah and this surely  caused great concern to the political  and religious authorities of Israel and  that was why they began to manipulate  and to change the people's mind about  Jesus they portrayed Jesus as a fraud as  a false messiah not truly the Messiah  that Israel was looking for this  explains why the people who welcomed  Jesus with such joy and expectation in a  few days time turn against the Lord  because they came to realize that Jesus  was a messiah that would bring peace of  the world through suffering and the  people could not accept that kind of  Messiah the kind of liberator they  wanted the liberator that would conquer  the Romans and restore to them the  kingdom of David they couldn't accept  the fact as we read in the second  reading of Saint Paul's letter to  Philippians that Jesus became man and  was humbled yet even to accepting death  left on the cross it was impossible to  listen to the first reading from prophet  Isaiah that this Messiah does not  retaliate against his enemies and so  the authorities the religious  authorities managed to change the minds  of the people to sway them to go against  Jesus but not only the richest authorities would not sincere  they were manipulative e hand they  accused Jesus of being a false messiah  on the other hand before the Romans they  accused Jesus of being a political rebel  of wanting to be the king of Israel so  we know my dear brothers and sisters we  can understand the sentiments of the  crowd the popular sentiments for most of  the common people they did not know the  undertones the political manipulation  that was at work behind the scenes  whether by the revolutionaries by the  Romans but the religious authorities or  trying to get rid of Jesus because Jesus  did not serve their purpose because  Jesus was a threat to the status quo and  the people in true for ignorant and this  is very true for all of us as well most  of the time the ordinary people are the  ones who are swayed by opinions  they follow the crowd they do not think they  do not descend they take whatever  is popular at that point of time that is  why we can appreciate why the people  turned against the Lord of course the  people they were ignorant that Jesus a  simple set was divined he did not clean  quality with  the people did not understand the  identity of Jesus they did not know that  Jesus the Messiah had to suffer that all  these were prophesied in the scriptures  as the passion story they met you tried  to showed they do not know the final  outcome of the life of Jesus they  thought he was a misguided matter but in  fact it was all part of the plan of God  and again as we read in a second reading  of simples letter to Philippines God  raised him high and gave him the name  which is above all other names so that  all beings should bend the knee in the  name of Jesus my dear brothers and  sisters we have the benefit of the high  side we know the outcomes of the passion  they did not they were just following  the events blindly and always swayed by  the popular sentiments where as for  Jesus he was surrendering himself to the  Father all the time my dear brothers and  sisters when we look at the way the  crowd turned against the Lord we can  forgive them that is why Jesus on the  cross  he said Father forgive them for they  know not what they are doing they do not  know that they were manipulated they did  not know that the authorities were  trying to get rid of Jesus they just  listened to them without understanding without making their own proper judgment  but what about forests we know the story  not only we have the hindsight of the  whole life of Jesus his passion is death  and resurrection we also have the  foresight the teachings of the church  the Scriptures do guide us in the way we  should live our lives and yet my dear  brothers and sisters this is truly sad  instead of listening to Jesus instead of  learning from examples of those who have  failed our Lord we are repeating the  same mistakes all over again we allowed  the world to manipulate us we allow the  world to condition us the world is  normalizing evil and we succumb to the  temptation the world is about violence  about killing about taking revenge to  the world is about myself my pleasure  me first I want it now the world does  not know about self sacrifice about  humility about forgiveness about putting  others before ourselves about  sacrificing ourselves for Humanity the  world is telling us better enjoy  yourself that is why the world does not  even take care of the planet this  failure in ecology is result of men'elfishness  all for himself  they are not worried about the future  generation today people killed where is  abortion oh this is my life they say  if I wonder commit suicide it is my  choice I'm free  my dear brothers and sisters do we  allowed all these fools fake news  half-truths to deceivers do we want to  listen to the world and betray Jesus or  do you want to listen to the Lord so my  dear brothers and sisters as we enter  into the Passion of Christ this Holy  Week we need to really ask ourselves are  we ready for this journey  are we ready to follow our Lord even to  the crossed  are we ready to stand up for Jesus or  were we betrayed him by the rest indeed  my dear brothers and sisters the passion  has already begun we are entering into a  most holy week never in the history of  my life at least maybe your life to that  we are celebrating this holy week in  such a situation where all of us cannot  come together where we are left with  just only a few people to celebrate this  liturgy for you it is really a very sad  experience it is really jesus asking us  to die to ourselves even to be strict of  all the ceremonies that we treasure so  much all the sacramentals we are  stripped like Jesus almost naked but  that is what the passion is and we have  to end or this my dear brothers and  sisters not just for our sake  for the sake of everyone so my dear  brothers and sisters nvite you as the  country goes into greater constraints in  the way we work in the way we socialized  or this physical distancing let e  these moments of being away from our  loved ones from our friends to use these  moments as grace of God for us to think  through our life and most of all to  appreciate what we often take for granted amen
