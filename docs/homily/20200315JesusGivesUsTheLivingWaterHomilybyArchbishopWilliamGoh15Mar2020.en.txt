  like the easter lights but the woman of  samaria we are testing for many things  in life we are terse most infamous for  our basic needs we can empathize with  the Easter lies in the first reading  when they complain against Moses because  they were dying of thirst water of  course is a basic need of life so to the  woman who came to draw water at the will  of Jacob it was a basic need that she  was trying to fulfilled but my dear  brothers and sisters very few of us are  contented with the basic needs of life  we all want luxuries we want to have  more the least wine when the Israelites  were in the desert after asking for  water they asked for bread but even that  bread was not good enough they asked for  meat and God gave them manna from heaven  and the trill as their mint and so for this woman   when she came to Jesus and  Jesus told her if only you knew what God  is offering you and who it is a saying  to you keeping a dream he would given  you living water this excited the  Samaritan woman leaving water it was  something that she was seeking but  she was thinking about the water that she  drew from the well but Jesus of course  was speaking about something more my  dear brothers and sisters we look at  ourselves what is this something more  that  we are seeking more than just the  physical and material needs of life what  is it that we are hungry today  the woman review saris what is the  deepest hunger of every human person  it is relationship we hunger for  authentic relationships with our  brothers and sisters before fellowmen  and we hunger for relationship with God  precisely this woman was without an  authentic relationship as Jesus  mentioned she had five husbands and the  one she was living with was not her  husband she fill in all the  relationships she never discovered a  true friend in her life that was what  was causing her to be insecure she was  living a lonely life what was a life  work and lived there was all for her in  life nor Tanish she was deprived of  authentic human relationship she did not  have relationship with God because my  dear brothers and sisters it is good for  us to understand the five husbands is in  John's Gospel actually it's a reference  to the book of Kings when the northern  kingdom was conquered by Assyria many of  the Easter lies intermarriage with the  pagans and as a result brought in five  for the 80s into the country and so  precisely Jesus saw the woman you  worship what you do not know we worship  what we do know  when we worship the wrong course in our  life this God cannot satisfy us this God  cannot fulfill us and so my dear  brothers and sisters what is he that  prevent us from cultivating a real  relationship if our brothers and sisters  and if God simply because    to cultivate a real relationship with  others just like this woman why because  we do not even know  ourselves because we cannot even accept ourselves because we  don't even locked ourselves we do not  even know our identity there was what  happened to this woman she did not know  herself she was afraid to confront her  loneliness her failures in life she was  trying to escaped  evade the issue when Jesus spoke to her  she was talking about God instead she  was not ready it was when Jesus  confronted her and she became more aware  of her inadequacies of a real hunger  that is why later on she would tell the  people come and see I mean see this man  who has told me everything I have ever  done it was a release from a prison to  know yourself is to be released from  your past provided you've learned to  accept your past and your brokenness and  not only that Jesus came to reveal to  her the true God Jesus said to her  God is spirit those who worship must  worship  in spirit and in truth Jesus revealed to  her first the woman said to Jesus  I see our prophet and then later on you  are the Christ and soon you are the  savior of the world  the woman came to discover the true  identity of Jesus and so we know my dear  brothers and sisters clearly today  the gospel bonds to tell us Jesus is the  living water in John chapter 7 verse 37  Jesus at the temple he cried out he who  is thirsty come to me and drink  and scripture says out of his heart will  flow rivers of living water the living  water of course came from his heart when  he was pierced if a soldier's Lance we  read that blood and water flowed blood a  symbol the Eucharist water a symbol of  baptism that is why we are preparing our  catechumens for  is  really to be washed clean and to be  filled with the living water what is  this living water what is it that can  satisfy us simple tells us this is the  living water the love of God has been  poured into our hearts by the Holy  Spirit which has been given to us to  have the living water is to experience  the love of God poured into our hearts  it is this love of God that would change  our lives  they were transformers that will give us  meaning that will give us the capacity  to love ourselves first and foremost so  that we can truly love others and  conditionally  and compassionately indeed my dear  brothers and sisters today the  Scriptures is clear Jesus is the living  water he's the one who were justified us  he came to save us a simple says and  died for us while re still sinners  we cannot save ourselves this race  impulse is true all know Jesus Christ by  faith we are just righteous and at peace  with God it is not by our merits that we  can be saved it is Jesus who brings down  all barriers between us and God  that is why in today's Gospel we read  how Jesus first and foremost brought all  social barriers status nationality race  language because he approached a woman  which was considered something that was  not to be done  Jesus grow all religious barriers when  he asked the woman for drink from the  utensils of the Samaritans dearly Jews  do not use the e tenses because they  were considered contaminated only Jesus  can reconcile us with one another by  reconciling us with God so my dear  brothers and sisters today as we  celebrate this Mass the responses some  beautifully sang for us o that today we  will listen to his voice harden not your  hearts what is required for us is to  have faith in Jesus faith is all that is  required for us to be safe  faith is order is required for us to  accept Jesus into our hearts Jesus into  our life when we do that then we will be  like this woman because this woman after  encountering the Lord  from a disciple she became an apostle  she said to her town's folk people come  and see a man who has told me everything  I've ever did she was no more shame of  herself she was no more hiding from the  people most of all we are tall she put  down her water jar and hurry back home  the water jar is a symbol of all that is  earthly a water jar can be broken by a  banning the water jar  the woman said I've discovered something  greater more than earthly pleasures of  life she has discovered Jesus who can  give us furnace of life to mine dear  brothers and sisters   you have all the power you are  men of status you may have plenty of  money are you happy have you found life  meaningful his life just work make money  having your ambition fulfilled or his  life having a loving relationship if  your spouse if your children if your  brothers and sisters and making a  difference in the life of others be not  just a disciple be an apostle like the  Samaritan woman because once you  encountered him you will tell everyone  come and see a man who has told me  everything I have ever done is he the Christ
