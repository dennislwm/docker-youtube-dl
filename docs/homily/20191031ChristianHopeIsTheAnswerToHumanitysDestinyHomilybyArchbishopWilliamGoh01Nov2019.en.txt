 the peace of all sins reminds us of our

 ultimate vocation delight that each one

 of us there is only one location is a

 vocation to be saved and to be a saint

 is our ultimate calling not just only

 when we die and we'd go to heaven and to

 be with Jesus to be the same already on

 this earth living the life of a saint as

 a foretaste of what is to come and

 there's reason why I think the face of

 all sins is such a beautiful feast to

 give each one of us our direction in

 life our goal and our purpose and our

 meaning an ultimate destiny so that we

 never fear life on earth we don't feel

 that as well at the other day this love

 the matters we want to loved we want to

 enjoy being loved and that is what

 happened is all about and we are caught

 to be his children to share in his life

 and love already we have a foretaste

 here and we found loved ones with our

 friends but in heaven it would be really

 a life of fullness of joy of nod and

 this hope of the scenes you know

 standing before the throne to worship in

 celebrating life this is the beautiful

 vision the blueprint is already given we

 just have to read this flag as a

 foretaste and we must believe that this

 life is beautiful despite with all his

 heart shaped if you have not gone

 through this life you will never

 appreciate heaven we want to be since to

 be saintly is to be down-to-earth try to

 live our life as meaningfully as

 joyfully celebrating lives there

 everything loved that is what the sin is

 all about no matter how unworthy

 we are so long as we know they are

 trying we are doing what we can the

 grace of God was supplement the rest

 because ovation ultimately because of

 cost the forest
