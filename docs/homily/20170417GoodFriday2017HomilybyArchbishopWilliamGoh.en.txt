 my dear brothers and sisters in Christ this world is a very wounded world where

 all of us are wounded in so many ways

 none of us is exempted from being

 wounded by our fellowmen

 indeed this world is supposed to be a

 place of unity of loved all of us we

 want peace and happiness in life but we

 find in our means our people who are so

 much wounded the wars that are being

 fought the terrorist activities they are

 expression of a society a world that is

 very much

 wounded because of the feelings of

 injustice discrimination and the work of

 evil my dear brothers and sisters if we

 are lamenting this fact that we are

 wounded and hurt by others it is good

 for us to realize this that we ourselves

 also hurt others we are not just on the

 receiving end we are also the patroness

 of evil of suffering that's the reason

 why we should not be too presumptuous to

 always think that people are hurting us

 as if we are not hurting

 but it's why in today's fashion as on

 Palm Sunday all of us are called to take

 part in this fashion drama that is why

 the response of the crowd is given to

 the people of God because Jesus too was

 wounded by our sins we do in our own

 ways have crucified Jesus and therefore

 don't say that people crucify us

 we are the innocent ones we are not when

 your brothers and sisters in the face of

 this reality as we celebrate Good Friday

 we want to ask ourselves how can we

 truly overcome the pain the hurts that

 we suffer in this life how can we so to

 speak to heal ourselves my dear brothers

 and sisters the prophet Isaiah tells us

 these bangies wounds we are even on him

 lies a punishment that brings us peace

 and through his wounds we are healed we

 do not suffer alone in this world we

 suffer with our fellow men every time

 when someone is suffering we are hurting

 otherwise we will be hurt in Britain

 I have always reminded people

 hurting people hurt people if people are

 not hurt they were not hurt us loving

 people loved people happy people makes

 others happy joyful people give joy to

 others angry people makes others angry hurtful people will hurt others it is as

 simple as this that is why if you think

 that you are going through this passion

 on your own it is not true every time

 when someone suffers even though we

 could be innocent partially we do was

 suffer the consequence and what will you

 do when you suffer the consequence of

 being hurt by people when you think you

 are innocent what do you do you

 retaliate that is the way pagans act I

 love you you love me you are nice to me

 I lie to you your bed to me don't expect

 me to be nice to you that is what Jesus

 said it is nothing new every human

 person responds in that manner resizing

 my dear brothers and sisters if you

 reflect on the passion today everything

 in terms of betrayal all of us have been

 betrayed many times in our lives and the

 people that betrayed us most and hurt us

 most deeply they are always our loved

 ones that is why the most different

 people to forgive in this life and not

 your enemies they are your loved ones who hurt you

 deeply your spouse your children your

  in-laws your parents your Guardians and of

 course your priest and Bishop and that

 is the truth

 because the more you love them and when

 they betray you

 you are scandalized you are shocked you

 look at Jesus Jesus too had to go to the

 same journey he's in a circle of friends

 the apostles that he had chosen he shed

 his life intimately with them for three

 years and they were the ones who had

 been denying st.</c> Peter not only Bandhan

 him denied him in front of a mate of a

 servant he was not courageous enough to

 stand up for Jesus and of course Judas

 his friends saw him for some money and

 that is true don't you feel that way to

 how many times especially in your

 workplace when your boss does not stand

 up for you when things are wrong who

 takes the responsibility not you not the

 boss it is you he will sacrifice you but

 he will not sacrifice himself he would

 not stand up for you he will make you a

 scapegoat so that he can get promoted so

 that he is taught well often how many

 bosses would stand by you and would even

 accept the mistake

 making himself responsible for the

 mistake that you have made a good boss

 will do that my dear brothers and

 sisters a good boss is the one who says

 I am responsible because at the end of

 the day if you are the boss you are

 responsible because the mark stopped at

 your place you cannot blame your

 subordinates because you're supposed to

 oversee them it's the same thing to any

 of the day anything that goes wrong in

 these dices even when it's done by the

 priest or by any person the bishop is

 responsible that is the burden of

 wearing the crown but if you don't stand

 by those people who work with you and

 who work for you then you are coward

 like Pilate Pilate was a coward he knew

 Jesus was right but he wanted to be

 popular he knew that Jesus was someone

 from above and yet because the fear of

 losing his position is power his office

 he surrendered him to the crowd even the

 chief priests have you when you read the

 gospel today what did they say we have

 no king we have no king but Caesar that

 is a religious heresy because for the

 Jews there is no other king except

 Yahweh they want to protect religion but

 in the end they in mind a very

 fundamental belief the whole that only

 God is the king not Caesar my dear

 brothers and sisters being crippled

 being slandered

 it's a painful reality for some of us

 here perhaps you are suffering today

 because you face failures in life

 nobody you wants to be a failure we look

 at many successful people and we are

 envious of them why are they doing so

 well that's not God love me and if you

 work hard you study hard you didn't meet

 the great you lose yourself confidence

  too you think you're not good enough and as

 if this is not bad enough even your

 parents will tell you you're not good

 enough wait it's just stupid look at all

 your friends huh

 your cousin next door can get 7 is you

 can do need 5 is lousy student and

 people make us feel that we are failures

 when you don't do things so well no one

 is perfect

 thus your boss encouraged you or just

 condemned you again

 often when we face fearless in life or

 sometimes in business those of you are

 doing very well in your profession and

 suddenly one day the business collapsed

 or you discover that you have a terminal

 illness in your young age of 3040 is

 difficult difficult to accept my dear

 brothers and sisters you think it was

 easy for Jesus on the cross except for

 three years he stood for his father for

 three years he proclaimed the father's

 love and mercy and his fidelity and when

 he has to meet his own end it was a

  failure the mission of Jesus and in failure by

 his nature everything that he believed

 in everything he worked for came to

 nothing with his doctor

 it was an apparent failure he had to

 accept his surrendered his failure to

 the father into your hands I commend my

 spirit but you know my dear brothers and

 sisters I think many of you suffering is

 this question of bereavement and paint

 you have someone taken away from us

 again is very painful I come across many

 they can no longer read it with God

 because God took their parents away when

 they were young parents died of cancer

 accident or sometimes your cure and

 young children died of tragic that is

 hard to believe that this God is loved

 and mercy when the ones you love so much

 or your wife your young spouse who has

 been taken away from you your backbone

 your pillar of strength you somehow will

 hit God it's difficult to accept when

 someone you love so dearly so close to

 you so dependent you are on this person

 and he's taken again my dear brothers

 and sisters have you wonder how Mary

 what Mary was thinking is only her only

 son was only 33 years old at the height

 of his life apparently very successful

 in the ministry and then steadily

 condemned to death Miri would have felt the same as you all

 mothers would feel if your son were to

 die at the age of 33 or younger so my

 dear brothers and sisters in the light

 of this that's why today the Scripture

 readings invites us to contemplate on

 the crucified Christ we are called to

 look at the Lord Jesus suffering because

 when you look at Lord Jesus suffering

 this is what we are told letting himself

 be taken for a sinner he was bearing the

 force of many bring all the times for

 sinners Jesus my dear brothers and

 sisters when we look and reflect on his

 suffering Jesus the man who carried our

 infirmities and our sufferings he was

 pierced through for our thoughts crushed

 for our sins that God would even die for

 us to become a man to be identified with

 our sufferings is something unimaginable

 that's right some of you like to ask me

 why does God allow such a thing to

 happen why does God permit me to suffer

 and I always tell people I don't have

 the answer I can give you some answers

 but there is no real answer it's a

 mystery but I can see this wanting to

 you even God Himself was not spared of

 suffering and is that you should know

 it's not the VI enjoying ourselves we

 faked Jesus God the Father suffer even

 much more when we suffer my dear

 brothers and sisters which parent here

 wish of you who have a loved one and

 when your loved one is suffering you

 don't feel you suffer even more to see

 your loved one suffering is even moved


- better suffering ourselves and that is

 how the Lord loves us so don't say that

 boat does not care

 suffering is a mystery that is true but

 don't say that God is indifferent he

 suffers more because he loves more the

 one who loves more will suffer more if

 you travel less is because you love less

 isn't it true you look at people

 suffering you don't care why because you

 don't love them if you truly love them

 you will suffer secondly Jesus suffered

 and innocent and he was a just man he

 didn't commit any sin we have committed

 sinned we did not suffer so to speak justly most of the problems we have we

 are partly responsible come on if your

 spouse were to go for another person

 infidelity have you ever asked did you

 play a part in it were you encouraging

 what you loving did you give time to

 your spouse if you support your spouse

 or was there a distinct already even

 before it happened same thing to some of

 you parents and your children to me all

 my son is the rebellious have you ever

 asked why because when they were young

 for the first seven years of their life

 you send them away to some kind of zoo

 no wish you visit every weekend you send

 them to your parents you sent them to

 somebody else BND from a busy the animal

 he says you go to the zoo and then after

 that Monday you go back home Sunday you

 can go back home how can the child ever

 have any warning with you and when the

 child grows up you bring him home that

 is even worse now you cut him off from

 the source of

 strength who is the people him then we

 therefore say therefore that it is not

 our scene

 think carefully my dear brothers and

 sisters in everything you need to answer

 plenty before we start accusing others

 that is us ourselves that is what the

 good thief total massive these men is

 innocent but we deserve our punishment

 and so my dear brothers and sisters

 indeed this afternoon I invite you to

 spend time reflecting on this challenge

 for us to accept the sufferings like

 Jesus do be positive in our suffering

 yes we all suffer that is a mystery but

 sufferings need not rickles need not

 make us bitter sufferings can make us

 better stronger more compassionate don't

 like giving it does not destroy us

 unless you allow yourself to be

 destroyed Jesus did not allow sufferings

 to destroy him he transformed that

 hatred of his enemies by love by

 forgiveness same thing -</c> for you you can

 transform in every time when I visit the

 hospital and I see patients I see

 patients who are suffering but some of

 them suffers so positively surrendering

 their lives to God and when you leave

 them you feel happy for them

 if you in spite by them I have come

 across many healthy people handsome and

 strong many of you here are handsome and

 strong but you are so miserable there is

 no peace in you I can see your heart

 your heart is not at peace you can eat

 you can drink and do many things but you

 have been you are not and those who are

 sick surprisingly seems to be more at

 peace dinners

 and happier so my dear brothers and

  sisters is it suffering or is it your attitude

 the worst suffering
