No one can be satisfied in life unless he has found the truth and unless he has found love. You can have all the things you want but if you do not have truth and love, then your life would be incomplete. That is the reason why, you know, when people have been wronged, when we suffer injustice, then we want to demand for justice. When we feel that we have been offended, then we want action to be taken, especially when people are suffering. And that is why sometimes,

you know, when people do something wrong, they are not at peace with themselves.

They also hurting. They live in fear actually. It's a matter of time when the oppressor will become the victim again.
It's important for us therefore to ask the Lord to help us to repent. When we respond to evil with evil, more and more evil consumes us until we are totally numb, totally blind. And for those of us who have done wrong, we have not been truthful, we have not been honest, then all we need to do is to listen to the Lord and to repent. I think repentance is for me the most important step. And then it's only when you repent, then we save ourselves from future worse disasters that could happen.
