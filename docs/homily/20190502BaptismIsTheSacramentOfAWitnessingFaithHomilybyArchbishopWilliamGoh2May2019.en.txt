What does it mean to be baptised? To be baptised requires a deep faith in Jesus, a deep commitment.

So how do you know that you have faith in Jesus? How do you know how deep is your faith?

How deep is your faith is not just the profession of Jesus but first and foremost your witnessing of Jesus. Whether you are ready to stand up for Jesus, whether you are ready to witness for Jesus in the face of trials, in the face of difficulties, in the face of challenges.

Will you be able to continue to be firm in your faith and be faithful to the Gospel teaching that we have been taught by the Lord? So,
how deep our faith in Jesus depends on whether we are witnesses to Jesus' life. And so, a witness always is called to testify. Whether we are witnesses to the Lord or not is dependant on how much we know Him. So, for those of us who pray more, those of us who read the Scriptures more, those of us who spend time with the Lord, then of course we know Him more. So, you can be a witness only if you obey. The only way to receive the Holy Spirit,
the only way to enter into the life of Jesus is obedience. If we surrender ourselves, then the Lord will enter into our lives. If we surrender in faith, then we will see miracles happening. So, let us pray that our faith will be deepened more and more, so that we can truly confess Jesus as our Lord and Saviour.
