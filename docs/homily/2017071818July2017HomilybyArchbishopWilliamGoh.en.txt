 this is the message of the day scripture

 readings that we should never receive a

 blessing for ourselves and give it

 within ourselves but we are blessed to

 bless others

 and this was the case of Moses he was

 saved he was delivered so that one day

 he could deliver these people out of

 slavery and true enough we are told that

 when Moses grew up he saw his fellow men

 being ghoulish by religion then of

 course he was incensed

 he was enriched and he killed the

 Egyptian to protect his fellow men so we

 can see how Moses saw to see those

 people who were in the situation and

 what he did that God sent us to save

 others simply because those of us who

 have gone through hard times in life

 those of us who have gone through

 sufferings those of us for one and the

 dogs then we can understand how those

 people are happy that is one is very

 difficult honestly had to feel for those

 people who are suffering if we had never

 been through that same journey and this

 is always the case that is why those who

 have been blessed with the blessings

 they tend to reach out to others who

 have locked

 but there is also a difficulty here or

 something that we should be happy

 Moses when he was delivered for foresee

 care for his countrymen but he did it

 the wrong way he's trying to correct the

 wrong by committing another road by

 killing the Egyptian it was not the way

 both of us who comes from a poor

 background a wounded background we have

 been molested before here in deprived of

 food for material things if you are not

 healed then there is a danger that we

 use our raw wounds to heal us and we

 have to be very happy with it that if we

 have come from a very different

  background we are concluded path before we have to

 make sure that our loons are killed

 before we can see a palace so if they

 don't you then they're going to manifest

 it in the ministry we can take it up all

 hours that is always the case and this

 is a fairness really that this is

 something that we never graduate with it

 properly or we do we don't take it

  seriously and this was what happened to Moses he

 was acting out from his raw wounds he

 was offended how the situation was

 actually angry pray the process peace

 for those who have been -</c> those have

 been killed those have been blessed then

 they are ungrateful causing the fighter

 and there's no problem right

 taking things over this is an extreme

 extreme of those people who have been

 blessed by God within distance window

 into themselves they are not serving

 they're not giving themselves and if

 ingratitude would actually result in the

 for and this is what Jesus was

 condemning the people from karate and

 the fighter and saying these miracles

 were done in Sodom then you would have

 they would have been converted and so

 sometimes you know two things lessons

 for some people that are English

 advocacy the very situation so people

 with who and ideally that they also move

 so that the spray at the displayed that

 we were being saved delivered let us

 respond repetitive ask me
