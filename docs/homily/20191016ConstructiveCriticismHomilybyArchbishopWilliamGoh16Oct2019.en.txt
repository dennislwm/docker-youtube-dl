Every time when we see there are some things that are unjust, we want to seek for justice.

But the justice of the world is never truly justice. The world's idea of justice basically boils down to revenge. When we make judgements,
very often we are presumptuous. Most of us,

we are blinded by our own vested interests.
Most of us, we are blinded by our own hurts and wounds in life. Those people who are very nasty in the way they condemn those people who sin, behind all this anger and resentment is a person who is very hurt. And so, these people are blind. They are blinded by their own anger and hatred. And that is why you notice the judgement is always unbalanced,
lacking objective because people are judging from the wounds of their past. Very often from their own fears as well. When we see the wrongs in others, most of the time they remind you of your own self. You don't like what you see in others because this person is bringing out all the things that you don't like about yourself. Because they are our mirror. And so we tend again to be very harsh because when we look at them, actually we are looking at ourselves. And we cannot accept ourselves. We cannot accept that this is the kind of person that we are. Our judgement is often presumptuous because we do not know all the facts. We just look at the incident,

we see things externally and we make a judgement.
We don't have all the facts. When we judge others, it could reflect our own fears, our own inadequacies and most of all, our own pain. That is why the judgement tends to be over exaggerated. So a person who is merciful,

sympathetic with others will also tend to be merciful towards himself. Otherwise you can let go. Otherwise you don'ake things too seriously. Otherwise you can feel sorry for them, not angry. That is why God's mercy is always perfect because God does not only look at the circumstances. He looks at the whole history. We should not judge. Let judgement be God's judgement.
