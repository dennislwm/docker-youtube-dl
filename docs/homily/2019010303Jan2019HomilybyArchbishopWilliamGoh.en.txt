 today as we continue to meditate on

 incarnation and the fact of the

 Incarnation is that all of us because of

 Jesus incarnation we come to realize

 that we are children of God so the birth

 of Jesus is not simply just a birth but

 more important the birth of Jesus brings

 about our own birthday as God's children

 Jesus baptizes with the Holy Spirit so

 when we are baptized with the Holy

 Spirit we are made sons and daughters of

 God and that is the reason why st.</c> John

 says you know I am baptizing you with

 water water is for the forgiveness of

 sins but that is not sufficient what is

 even more important is that we are made

 sons and daughters of God and that is

 why the Holy Spirit is even by Jesus so

 that we can enter into Christ's sonship

 and so this is important for us because

 this is the basis for Christian baptism

 today the first reading we are told and

 actually in truth all of us are God's

 children without baptism you will never

 know that your son and a daughter of God

 but in God's eyes all of us are

 insurance the baptism is actually

 rectification it is a celebration it is

 a experience of what it means to be a

 son and a daughter and sin prevents us

 from recognizing God as our Father that

 is the reason why why do we treat our brothers and sisters our

 fellow men do you know in a way that is

 not true the rudder Li and systole

 because we don't see each other as

 brothers and sisters because we don't

 see each other as God as our Father so

 sin prevents us from recognizing our

 true identity as sons and daughters not

 only since the effects of sin you see

 when we don't treat each other well when

 we cut each other we become wounded and

 you know the effects of sin brings more

 wounds and that is why people who fall

 into sin and not just wanting to sing

 before it suffer the effects of the sin

 they become bitter you know when you are

 forgiven when you are here then you

 begin to see people positively even

 negative things we see positively

 because we are healed so they show a

 sock on reconciliation brings about real

 healing and that is why Jesus is the

 Lamb of God who takes away the sins of

 the world to take away the sins of the

 world means that we are forgiven but

 more than that the effects of our sins

 taken away is the experience of sonship

 recovering back to identity
