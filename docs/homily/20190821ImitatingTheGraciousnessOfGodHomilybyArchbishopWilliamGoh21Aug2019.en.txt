 for most of us justice being said we

 presumed that all of us are equal it is

 true with regards to our dignity before

 God all of us are equal but it is not

 true that we all have equal

 opportunities equal talents equal

 resources all these things are given we

 are not therefore in that sense equal in

 all these gifts some of you have been

 blessed with more some it lists some new

 gray matter some rest

 why again you know it is the Lord's

 choice some of you are born into rich

 families some of us are born into poor

 families we have the struggle to rise so

 in this sense life is not fair which

 means to say therefore is very unfair of

 us to impose on others our maintenance

 of justice just because you can do more

 should you be paid more when I do less

 but because I have less opportunities I

 have less talents so what is today's

 scripture understanding of justice first

 and foremost the basic principle all

 that we have comes from God we need to

 be very clear if you are rich if you are

  intelligent if you are doing well in life if you get

 a good job it's cause blessing nothing

 actually build on space and God can at

 any point of time take them away -</c> if we

 are not careful so we need to be first

 and foremost gracious and to recognize

 that everything we have

 every opportunity our state of life our

 wealth our health all comes from home

 that's the first point so they start

 interest to compare it is important for

 us also to realize whether we are rich

 whether we are poor with a talented

 talented on the vessel equal in the eyes

 of God

 so stripped of all our position and

 offices is Iran when we die we are equal
