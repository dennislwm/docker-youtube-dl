 it is very normal for us as human beings

 to judge from appearances because we

 cannot see the heart of the person and

 this is where we have to be very careful

 today especially when we are talking

 about making judgments and assessing

 situation there is always the danger of

 presumption they just look and then they

 make a conclusion without understanding

 the real situation we caused a lot of

 harm to those people who are innocent

 and also caused division in the

 community and after that to redeem

 becomes extremely difficult whatever we

 see we need to clarify we need verify we

 need to ask we need to understand Jesus

 do not simply look at the external

 reality he wants to go back to the

 original intention what lies behind the

 action that is more important than the

 action itself

 God does not see as man sees man looks

 at appearances but the Lord looks at the

 heart
