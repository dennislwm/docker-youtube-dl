Although all of us are baptised, not everyone has responded to the grace of God. Different people have received God's grace differently or at different levels. Have we really received the grace of God? If you have received the grace of God, then it's very easy. Then you know that what you have, your whole being,
your body, whatever you have, your soul, no longer belongs to you. It belongs to God.
If you really belong to God, then everything you do, your talents, your health, your time,
your resources, everything for the glory of God. Everything for the service of His Kingdom.
Everything for the service of love. You want to do everything to glorify Him. But when you use your body for selfishness, you use your mouth to hurt people, you use your hands to hurt people, then you are on the side of sin. So if you continue to sin, it means to say you don't appreciate what you have received.

That means the grace of God have been received in vain. Using our time wisely, using our talents responsibly, then that person will always find peace. There is nothing to worry.

And actually, at the end of the day, it's for our own good, it's not only for the good of others. It's just for our own good as well because we feel our lives are worth living and that we have lived it well. Those of us who are irresponsible with the grace of God,

ultimately we will hurt ourselves. The more you are blessed, then the more you are called to give back. That is the principle of life.
If God has blessed you with more, it means that God expects more from you. So let us pray and rely on God's grace and ask the Lord to help us to be grateful for all that He has blessed us with, so that we can use it for His greater glory.
