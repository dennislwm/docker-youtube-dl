 today in the scripture reading in the

 first reading we have Abraham and Lord

 we find that the community was growing

 in numbers and kept on growing and

 growing and as a result there was

 tension there was competition and they

 did not have naft for everybody to

 prosper and so we find a brand very

 generous in offering to Lord saying to

 know that the land is vast

 which would separate so that the

 communities would have little

 portunities to flourish so there was a

 solution to separate and to make their

 own progressed this way of extending the

 community of helping a community to grow

 was a practice that continues even in

 our days but clearly ancient days we

 know that nations expanded through

 conquest through influence and so those

 with military might will conquer other

 nations and then to able to extend their

 territory so that the people would have

 more land to grow their crops

 the faster the flocks and even today

 although expansion is no longer in terms

 of territorial expansion the world used

 economic political powers to control and

 influence other nations those foreign

 nations they are subservient to some

 extent to powerful nations they want to

 control them politically

 using technology and economic power so

 this strategy of conquering a strategy

 that has been used and today continue to

 be used in different ways

 religions are no exemption if you look

 at the history of humanity religions

 also try to extend myself through

 influence through propagation and very

 often also through some coercion like

 buying the faith of the people by

 offering economic benefits or even

 sometimes a political powers so even

 religion to make use of such a strategy

 for expansion when we do this it can

 cause tension it can cause resentment I

 suppose in the orden days as such a

 strategy was permissible or was accepted

 as a way of life simply because the

 inhabitants in the world were much fewer

 and people were uneducated less

 sophisticated most superstitions and

 therefore the big nation is a small

 nation that was the way big fish eat

 small fish and those with bigger

 cultures then impose their cultures on

 the smaller ones again as I said perhaps

 in those days when people were ignorant

 and most people were homogeneous in the

 country is homogeneous

 there was no what we call not much of a

 migration and so most people they would

 think that a culture must be the most

 that the religion is the best and so

 when they confront new territories they

 want to impose their cultures their

 faith on these people but you notice

 that in today's world this strategy of

 increasing our own private space is no

 longer tenable today the emphasis is on

 increasing common space rather than

 private space simply because with

 globalization with migration then

 society has become more cosmopolitan we

 are no more homogeneous as was in the

 past especially for cities where we have

 different cultures different

 nationalities different religions and so

 these will have great impact on the way

 we approach people of other faiths

 people of other cultures I think this is

 a very important consideration for us

 because you know Abram showed great

 generosity when he told not there is so

 much land whichever you choose I will

 choose the other way but you go and

 explore so today because we are talking

 about the question of how to we promote

 unity among ourselves when there is a

 great emphasis on secularism in

 individualism relativism and as the

 community grows also even within our own

 churches today we have so many cultures

 you know even liturgical rites there are

 so many logical rights how do we

 accommodate everyone so that there would

 be unity and love and even for us among

 ourselves then there is also a greater

 challenge for us how can we work

 together as brothers and sisters as one

 body as one church otherwise the

 community can become contentious and

 complemented and the last thing we want

 is to have a divided community because a

 divided community cannot do anything for

 church cannot do anything for God

 because communion is always the

 underpinning of mission if we are not

 united in love if we are not invited in

 our mission if we don't support each

 other no matter how much good each

 individual can do will destroy the

 mission of the church and we can no

 longer be the sign of that unity and so

 how do we go about it today the gospel

 gives us the three principles how how do

 we respect people who are different how

 to instead of increasing our private

 space the Lord is telling us increase

 the common space that is the way to

 promote unity and love increasing our

 common space following the first

 principle jesus said so always treat

 others as you would like them to treat

 you that is the meaning of the law and

 the prophets in other words what we need

 to emphasize therefore is what we have

 in common and we actually all common

 even if their different religions and

 different couches we all have the same

 let no one FX old-blood you know we

 don't have EXO police the blood is the

 same we have the same aspiration whether

 you are Catholic and non-catholic we

 want peace we want love with one harmony

 we want moocher understanding we want

 Paulo runs we want forgiveness we want

 comfort everything that anyone who is a

 human being desires is what we desire

 and so if we focus on the human

 aspirations and those needs are

 universal you don't have to be exactly

 don't have to be a Muslim or you don't

 have to be a believer even to see all

 these values of life so that is why

 Jesus is saying therefore respect others

 as you like to be respected so if we

 want to increase the common space means

 to say we try to emphasize and to feel

 with one another and that is the of

 Christian message the heart of Christian

 message is really to love God to love

 your neighbor and you ask yourself that

 is the centrality of our message and

 that is the reason why in that sense if

 we follow this principle then we will

 learn how to accommodate each other and

 most of all rendering respect one

 another to be sensitive to one another

 and not to impose you know ourselves or

 others secondly Jesus said you know

 don't give what to dose what is holy

 do not throw pearls in front of pigs or

 they may tremble them and then turn on

 you and

 you to pieces it does not mean to say

 those people who are not in agreement

 because they are all dogs and picture we

 are saying that so the point is

 therefore there are some people who

 might not appreciate our culture

 appreciate our faith and so what do we

 do well they are ignorant they don't

 understand or perhaps sometimes we don't

 even understand them so they shall need

 therefore again for mutual dialogue or

 fostering friendship so that it takes

 fine to grow course of a person I mean

 patient people love wonder why hobbies

 do not convert no so many years really

 sharing the favorite events you don't

 want to be Catholic you know or this

 person why take so long because of the

 fact that some of us we are ignorant

 some of us are conditioned by our past

 or prejudice and it takes time so don't

 force on others what they don't

 understand and then finally Jesus says

 enter the narrow gate since that road

 leads to petition is white and spacious

 take the narrow gate which means to say

 having recognized that we are different

 the cultures of people are different at

 the same time we take the narrow gate we

 must be true to what we believe we don't

 have to compromise our beliefs just

 because others disagree with us we agree

 to disagree respectfully and I think is

 very important because some people think

 interest dialogue is syncretism this is

 totally against the spirit of

 internalized dialogue some people think

 English individual is to bring all

 faiths into one so we select whatever is

 good and we have one faith that is not

 interfered interfaith means to

 appreciate our differences

 to appreciate the richness of different

 cultures different faiths

 might not believe but we see there are

 some things that are good that can be

 useful for our growth so interfaith

 therefore presumes that each one is firm

 in his or her faith and true dialogue

 but things can happen but that is the

 wisdom of God that is the gift of God so

 it is it will it would be a impoverished

 act for your faith if you think that to

 bring unity among religions is to give

 up your own faith that is why Jesus said

 you know you have to take the narrow

 gate in this way we will be able to find

 life at the same time to be enriched by

 others
