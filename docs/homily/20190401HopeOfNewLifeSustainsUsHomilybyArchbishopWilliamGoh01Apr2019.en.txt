The reason why many of us are not happy in life, it is simply because we cannot leave our past behind. We cannot leave our woundedness behind. We cannot leave all those people who have hurt us behind. We cannot forgive ourselves for the mistakes that we have made. We continue to dwell always on the past. And so long as we keep on clinging to our past, to our mistakes,

to all those people who have hurt us, there is no way for us to go forward. That is why there are some people who cannot share in the resurrection because they are forever dead. And to be dead means to live precisely in the past. And so it is very important for us, if we want to move forward, we need first and foremost to forgive ourselves and not to delimit the power of God. When we live in the past, we are preventing the grace of God from working. It is a question of leaving the past and being open to the possibilities that God wants to give to us. It is an act of faith. Do you have enough faith to allow God to work in your life? Do you believe that God can give you a new life? Let us with confidence ask the Lord to help us to be more open, to be more receptive to how the Lord is going to work miracles in our lives. Let us be courageous.
Let us takes risks. Once we surrender ourselves to the Lord, the Lord can do wonders. It is allowing the Lord to work in our lives, to trust in Him that somehow the Lord will provide for us and will help us to work for His kingdom and to give glory to Him.
