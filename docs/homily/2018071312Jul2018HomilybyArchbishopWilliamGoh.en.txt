 but God is always our loving father the

 one who provides us all our needs the

 one who looks after us

 and we are his children and he had like

 all children we often take our parents

 for granted like all children we know

 how to receive but we do not know how to

 gift and like all children we tend to

 take our parents left not only for

 granted but we abuse the love of our

 parents and that is the way we human

 beings respond to God's love and yet as

 I've said many of us actually again we

 are like the children we don't

 understand that is the love of God very

 forgiving God a God who looks after us a

 God who is patient in helping us to grow

 up and we need time to grow up and so

 this God not only because he is such a

 loving God he's also a forgiving God

 Prophet Hosea compares the love of God

 to parent Allah that kind of loved and

 so today you know if we have received

 this love what the gospel is inviting us

 to gift that loved away this is where

 Jesus said go and proclaim the kingdom

 of God you receive without charge give

 without charge so the point is that

 those of us receive therefore mass

 therefore gift freely and I think it's

 important there are two things here

 first you must receive freely before you

 can give freely I think that is a basic

 point because if you don't receive

 freely you cannot give freely Jesus to

 the disciples when you go you know

 provide yourself no gold no silver

 nothing why so that they will be

 dependent on God when we are powerless

 when we are not self-sufficient and then

 when we are being looked after we have

 great food that's why we begin to share

 with others because we ourselves have

 been totally dependent

 Chris the other part is lonely we did

 freely receive freely we differently

 those people who won't be invite to

 receive our gifts there must also be a

 freedom of response so don't get angry

 you know you want to help people people

 don't want to be helped

 what can we do because then it's what

 Jesus said when you go to a person's

 house you know I guess a peace upon you

 and if he doesn't want then the peace

 will turn back to you there so we cannot

 force so there is also a freedom of

 response I think it's important also

 that when they talk about freedom

 responds to respect because at the end

 the day in order to receive freely we

 also have to give freely but the person

 who received it must be free the moment

 you impose the gift it is no more a gift

 and it is really for me the highest form

 of laughter and that is the love of God

 precisely the first breathing

 he loves really and we don't rest we

 don't respond to his love he does he

 stop living you know he still loves he

 still offers if one day you want to have

 it he will give it to us he doesn't see

 you must have it you know I would

 destroy you know what is the one who

 says I will forgive you and so for me

 the greatest act of love is not just to

 give freely but to be able to allow the

 person to receive give free if the

 person rejects it we just want brainer

 so we just have to pray and continue to

 be like a heavenly father keep on giving

 and just waiting for them to say yes

 accept your gift
