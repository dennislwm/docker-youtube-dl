 these are recorded so that you may

 believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son

 of God and a believing test you may have

 life through his name my dear brothers

 and sisters there are still many people

 in the world today not only they do not

 believe in Jesus Christ

 as a son of God they do not even

 believed in God the latest statistics in

 Singapore has shown that there is a

 little increase in the number of people

 who profess themselves as agnostics as

 atas humanists from 17 to 18 percent so

 almost one-fifth of the population in

 Singapore they do not believed in God at

  all my dear brothers and sisters is good to

 ask ourselves why is it that there are

 so many people in the world who do not

 believe in God the question is simple

 answer is simple because God is absent

 from their lives because as was in

 Thomas said he cannot see if you cannot

 see God then you begin to doubt his

 existence and his presence and this is

 so true it is very difficult to see God

 in our lives today because where do we

 see God

  really we see God when the experience is loved

 and his mercy in the response some we

 are told that God was experienced by the

 Israelites as being so good as the one

 who delivered them from the slavery

 under the Egyptians so my dear brothers

 and sisters when a person no longer

 encounter God's love and mercy in his

  life it is but a step towards a Haysom and I

 tell you the truth the world that we

 lived in is a very cruel world that is

 why it's difficult to see God's mercy

 and love today for three reasons firstly

 this is a world based on meritocracy if

 you work hard if you can contribute to

 the family and to society then you

 deserve a place to stay and to live if

 you no longer can contribute if you are

 weak if you are a disadvantaged person

 and if you are elderly

 your children will even see you as a

 burden as a nuisance and secretly they

 pray for your early daft otherwise they

 will have to be advocates of ducaine

 easier in this country you know my dear

 brothers and sisters this is so true

 have a come across many many cases but

 today children define their elderly

 parents a real

 and in their life and you wish that they

 were not wrong because you have to look

 after them so in a world of meritocracy

 you only have a place if you can

 contribute that is why all those people

 who are useless then you don't deserve

 to leave and isn't it true even the

 elderly tells me the same thing father

 I'm so old now I'm useless I want to die

  useless because why we are not loved for who we

 are we are only loved if we are useful

 the users like they use things if the

 thing cannot be used anymore you just

 discard and that's the way we do with

 people meritocracy the second reason why

 God is absent is because this society we

 lived in is intolerant of mistakes

 we cannot forgive those who have made

 mistakes in life once you are criminal

 forever a criminal there was this lady

 who came to me crying she was in

 depression and very well fun when she

 goes to the Superman sometimes she

 forgets to pay and she was caught for

 shoplifting even the children labored

 her as a teeth teeth my dear brothers

 and sisters if you have been a drug

  addict you've been a creamer every time when

 people see you they see the word

 criminal your life is finished

 you cannot redeem yourself even though

 you try this is an ex-offender they saw

 they label you this world cannot forgive

 if your spouse were to commit adultery

 the next thing you ask is the divorced

 there is no question of forgiveness

 there is no question of helping a person

 to redeem himself of herself and this is

 said even within the church in Church

  Ministries how many of you are forgiving and

 tolerant of each other even in the

 church we are not tolerant if somebody a

 little boys crying Li the baby is crying

 they are not tolerant they will complain

 the priest you never get this baby to

 stop walking but it's a baby alone we

 are not tolerant church members are

 fighting because one church member makes

 a mistake finished even in the church

 Pope Francis I have a nice poster

 outside the church is a place of Mercy

 where everyone is forgiven is given hope

 and is welcome is this reality in our

 churches not always not always the

 reason why people cannot experience God

 today is simply because they have lost

 hope and meaning in life they no longer

 know what they are living for we don't

 have God in your life

 there is no meaning there is no purpose

 especially when you see so much

 sufferings in this world so much

 injustice I know my dear brothers and

 sisters that was what st.</c> Thomas

 experienced he could not see the Lord

 because he was hurt he was wounded he

 couldn't accept how his master could

 have been put to death and just leave he

 can't believe that Jesus that God is

 loved and that is why Jesus had to

 appear to him with his wounds

 with his wounds so that he will know

 that God is mercy that his resurrection

 shows that God is justest

 all of us my dear brothers and sisters

 we enter the same situation as in Thomas

 but in truth today we can rejoice

 recently because of the marvels of God

 which we have just sound God is merciful

 and how do we know how do we let the

 world know that this God we worship is a

 merciful and loving God this God first

 and foremost comes to heal broken hearts

 the disciples were hiding the upper room closed doors they were afraid of enemies

 from without but the real enemy was from

 within they were ashamed they were

 living in guilt for betraying a master

 they couldn't forgive themselves they

 couldn't accept themselves they were

 hiding the upper room that is why Jesus

 came the first thing that he reprimand

 them you traitors when I would need that

 you where were you but that's what you

 do if you're supposed to do something no

 I tell you you stupid fellow now he

 deserve it but that was too much jesus

 said twice he said peace be with you he

 didn't talk about his past he didn't

 recount all the feelings of the

 disciples peace be with you

 Jesus close to him

 wounded hearts people who are feel

 ashamed for their past and the Lord has

 taken these away peace be with you

 the Lord has come not only Hugh broken

 hearts he has come to restored us in our

 bodies as well in the first reading

 which we have written actually the

 forces we have st.</c> Peter even the shadow

 of st.</c> Peter fell on those who were sick

 they were healed those who were under

 possessions they were delivered My dear

 brothers and sisters the trouble with

 many Catholics is this they think that

 all these miracles of healings of

 deliverance are something of the past

 there is one many Catholics they don't

 see the power of God and good in your

 life that's why their faith is weak the

 only time you hear of God's power at

 work in your life is when you go to

 novena church and you hear many

 petitions of thanksgiving but in our own

 churches you don't hear often and you

 think that god is dead

 every Sunday you come here to fulfill

 obligation but you have not heard the

 wonderful stories of people being killed

 and these miracles are still happening

 today over and over again

 let me tell you and I've seen with my

 own eyes god is great

 he hews not just our bodies he comes to

 heal even our minds we have seen Thomas

 again he is representative of those who

 are skeptical those who are a taste who

 refused to believe there some of us our

 minds are closed like Saint Thomas we

 have already made up our mind even today

 80's those of you who are doubting the

 law extends his Healing Hands to open

 our minds to enlighten us that he is

  truly merci so you know my dear brothers and

 sisters when you reflect on all these

 events the Lord giving us life once

 again and purpose in us in John into the

 second reading he was in the Hyderabad

 most he was imprisoned for preaching the

 Word of God did he fall into depression

 was he angry with God then he had to

 suffer exile no he had this vision of

 Jesus as the Alpha Omega the first and

 the last st.</c> John could see that

 everything falls in place that is right

 don't say that my life is meaningless

 why as I go through sufferings

 everything is in the hands of God there

 is a purpose for everything that God

 allows to happen in our lives we can see

 but we know that God is in charge the

 even the sufferings you go through will

 become redemptive for you if you use

 them well and that is what the Lord has

 shown us and so many fathers and sisters

 don't say therefore that our God is

 absent he's present and today if we have

 received this mercy what must we do

 and you must extend that mercy and the

 greatest mercy you can give is what

 forgiveness that was the gift that Jesus

 gave to the Apostles received the Holy

 Spirit for those who since he forgive

 they are forgiven those sins you retain

 they are retained the greatest mercy we

 can give to anyone I believe more than

 just corporal works of mercy is

 forgiveness there is none of us here who

 does not need forgiveness

 because we are all sinners because we

 are not perfect but many of you cannot

 forgive cannot let go you will

 resentment in your heart bitterness

 you can't forgive your loved ones your

 spouse your parents your superiors you

 continue to hold all these grudges anger

 in your heart that is why you are still

 in the tomb this is really low Sunday

 days octave of Easter

 the Lord is reason the stones have been

 taken away here's your hiding the tomb

 and why because you do want to share in

 this power of forgiveness you can

 receive forgiveness if you don't forgive

 yes the Lord has forgiven you that is

 true but until you forgive that come

 forgiveness is not complete that's why

 the Lord said whose sins you forgive

 they are forgiven whose sins retain they

 are retained for eveness is the greatest

 mercy we can do for anyone if you want

 to restore someone back to life

 besides forgiveness there are spiritual

 works of mercy bring keep them to Jesus

 that is also a great book of mercy those

 of you whether you're in a choir whether

 your catechize whether your wardens

 whether you bring coming into the sick

 these are all works of mercy

 anyone who bring someone to Jesus is a

 great economist see enlightening someone

 about Jesus that is a great economist

 see because the greatest gift we can

 give to anyone is always Jesus divine

 mercy have you done that have you done

 that of course better still besides this we

 have copper wealth of mercy

 serving the poor I tend to your own

 loved ones at home please please

 I hear enough of such stories your

 elderly at home don't forget about them

 don't make them feel their nuisance because one day you will also be all mmm

 and your children do the same thing to

 you that I'm don't complain to me

 because I'll be dead and gone it's too

 late so my dear brothers and sisters

 indeed today as we celebrate this feast

 that is pray if you want to find mercy

 be like st.</c> Thomas or rather don't be

 like Saint Thomas he was outside the

 community of faith he couldn't see Jesus

 if you want to see Jesus today

 you must stay within the community

 brothers and sisters we must support

 each other let us make Jesus His mercy

 present to each other so that we can

 bring mercy to the world if you can't

 even find divine mercy in the church I

 think we are finished to a shop to shop

 honestly let us begin with divine mercy

 wherever we are in our families in a

 Christian community
