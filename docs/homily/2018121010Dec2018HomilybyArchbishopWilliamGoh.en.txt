We all have our winter experience in life. And many of us during this time of the year, we might be worried about our finances, about our career, about our job,

about our health, about many things that trouble us, and we feel kind of hopeless and even depressed, whether we can ever get out of this situation that we are in.

If you are in that situation, we must have hope,

we must hang on to Jesus. God is a God of surprises.

Miracles do happen and we must believe.
That's why those of you who are sick,

those of you who feel that you are at the end of the road, don't give up because God can surprise you. For God, nothing is impossible. All you need to do is to have faith. Faith means that we are open to the power of God at work in our lives. Don't delimit the power of God.
Don't put constraints on how God wants to work in your life. If you surrender in faith, the Lord will raise you up. And so during this season of Advent, not only we are called to be people of hope, we must be people who bring hope to others. There are many people, they lack faith. That is why you must strengthen their faith. You must give them hope. Let us be the hope for all those people who are looking for hope, in our love, in our charity, and most of all by leaving them to Jesus.
