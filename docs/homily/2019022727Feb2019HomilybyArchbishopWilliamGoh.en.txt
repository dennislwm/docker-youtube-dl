 there is always this tendency that other

 people must be part of our group part of

 our organization they must be laundress

 otherwise we will exclude them

 this attitude very often springs from

 fear from insecurity from narrow

 mindedness when we approach life with

 this kind of attitude there is the

 danger of sowing seeds of discord of

 division of competition and very often

 becomes factors to divide society are we

 seeking truth and loved I'll be on the

 same page in wanting to promote

 authenticity in life are we on the same

 page in helping everyone to meet the

 fullness of life are we on the same page

 in promoting justice respect when we

 look at the big picture of paying

 attention to the human person not the

 organization then I think we can come to

 some common agreement is the

 organization more important or are we

 more concern in how to help people how

 to help people to encounter Jesus how to

 help people to live authentic lives if

 we are focused on persons then we can

 journey with people and together we find

 the fullness of life in truth in this

 way we can collaborate with everybody so

 long as we are all the same page we are

 seeking true wisdom through love and

 meaning and purpose
