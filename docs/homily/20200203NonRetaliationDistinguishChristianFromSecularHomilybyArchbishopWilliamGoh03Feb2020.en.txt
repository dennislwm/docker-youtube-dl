The world uses retaliation as the way to overcome enemies. Yet this is not the way that Jesus wants us to do. The way to overcome our enemies should be the way of the Gospel. Whenever you have a war,
many people would die innocently. And what about their loved ones? What about their families? Wars never solve a problem.

It creates more problems. The pain, the tragedy. When people criticise you, when people are nasty, when people come with sweeping accusations and statements, it hurts, definitely. We are human beings, it hurts.
But also, it really calls for humility to try to understand why these people are reacting, why they are angry, why they are not happy.
What they said, is it true or maybe some half-truths. Maybe there is some truth. So it takes a lot of humility to take it in a positive light, to weigh all these different opinions. Not all are true. Some could be half-truths. As Saint Paul tells us in Romans 12, "Let the vengeance be taken by God Himself." God will know what to do. Always try to bring the best out of a situation. I think we need to pray for that patience, that humility, to bring the best out of every difficult and negative situation, and to see the positive light of it. Because even sometimes in negative situations, they're meant to help us to grow. They are not necessarily our enemies.
Our enemies actually are sometimes our best friends, because they really teach us how to be strong and how to grow in character, in virtues.
