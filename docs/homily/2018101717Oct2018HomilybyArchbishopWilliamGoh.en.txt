This life is very complex. We are torn between living a life of lawlessness and a life based on the laws. Laws are given so that we will know what is right and what is wrong because sometimes we lack sensitivity, we lack clarity. The laws are given because they are meant to guide us and to help us to live our lives in a way that will bring harmony, so that people will be able to relate with each other in a just, in a merciful manner,
and most of all in their relationship with God. Lawlessness - Legalism. The only way to overcome and to bridge these two - it is the law of love. So when there is love, you transcend all the laws. When there is love, we do not become legalistic. When there is love, you are also aware of your own weaknesses. You don't condemn others. When there is love, we try to be motivated by love. Whatever  it for love. So that's why when there is love, there is no law in that sense. And so, laws are necessary because love is lacking, that's what laws are necessary.
Otherwise, anyone who is led by the spirit transcends the law. So the question is how then can we fulfill the law unless there is love.
Where can we find this love? How can we be motivated always by love? This is where precisely we depend on God. That's why we need to be connected with the Lord. So it doesn't mean to say being connected with the Lord every day, we are loving people. But the more we love the Lord,

or the more we allow the Lord to love us, then we'll be able to transcend the law.

Otherwise without the love of God in us, our life is going to be very difficult.
