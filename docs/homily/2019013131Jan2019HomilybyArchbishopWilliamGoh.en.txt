 many of us we do not hold firm now field

 simply because we do not grow in our

  field faith is like a relationship it has to

 grow if it is not different it is not

 renewed then the relationship dies the

 first way to grow up here is to grow in

 intimacy with the Lord so every one of

 you must approach the Lord Jesus in

 prayer intimacy without this intimacy of

 the Lord in prayer

 there can be no growth are we attentive

 to the Word of God the Word of God again

 is indispensible for spiritual life on

 growth there is no way for us to deepen

 our faith without hearing the Word of

 God without Indy realizing the Word of

 God and so this is where it's important

 to sustain that relationship through the

 Word of God the community is very

 important for spiritual growth we need

 to encourage one another we need to

 affirm each other we need to support

 each other without the support of people

 is very difficult to journey in faith

 the design we gather together not just

 community meetings in those official

 meetings coming together for informal

 fallacy coming together for informal

 activities this is all very important

 coming together to share our faith to

 share press together they help us to be

 more bonded it is important to witness

 to fail in order to grow there is no way

 we need to talk about Jesus if you don't

 show your fear the little faith that you

 have will also be forgotten it is

 important that we have a clear

 conscience at the end of the day it is

 the way of life it is a witness of life

 trying to put into practice what we

 believe that also strengthens our faith

 so we need to pray that maybe

 consistent with the light that believes

 so that people who will have confidence

 in this
