 this life that we lived is full of

 worries full of Bourbons the burdens of

 life so long as we our life cannot be

 copied off completely whether we are all

 whether we are young these burdens of

 life will always be with us

 burdens of our past continue to haunt us

 even though we try to let go and then we

 also have the burdens of the present and

 this can also make us feel tired and of

 course we have also burdens of the

 future we are worried about our needs

 Ariba our health so these things they do

 certainly bother us because all of us we

 cannot but carry out process then how to

 be carried out we need to shoulder the

 yoke of Jesus don't desire another crust

 because it doesn't fit you the cross the

 god sense that is the cross that we are

 called to overcome the cross we are

 called to purify ourselves to strengthen

 ourselves and to grow so sometimes in

 our sufferings and so on this is thought

 in parcel of life we need to go true

 there is no way there is no way for us

 to escaped because there is no way for

 us to grow except true that way

 happiness and live is again a question

 of perspective at the end everybody

 suffers everybody has the burden has

 their own share of burden in this life

 in scientists but it's how we look at it

 is how we see from perspective of Christ

 and Jesus himself surely he must have

 lots of burdens as well he feels a lot

 of opposition's and yet though he was a

 man at peace because he surrendered to

 God because he trusted in God humility

 to trust in the Lord ability to learn to

 be purified to grow along the way and if

 we do that then of course our sufferings

 will always be

 time of purification that is pray for

 the give of faith and patience amen
