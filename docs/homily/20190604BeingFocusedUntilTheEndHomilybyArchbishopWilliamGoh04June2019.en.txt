 all of us are cool for a mission and

 today the scripture readings are very

 inspiring because we have two persons we

 have Jesus we have simple they were

 committed to the mission right to the

 end without wasting time without wasting

 resources they gave everything that they

 had simple was very focused when his

 whole life very focus in fulfilling the

 mission the Lord has entrusted to him

 and so it's important to ask ourselves

 because we are disciples of Jesus every

 one of us is given a mission all of us share the mission of Christ in various

 ways whether you are married whether you

 are single whether in working in a

 church or working in the corporate world

 which have a profession you are in that

 is immaterial the point is that every

 one of us somehow is for to fulfilled

 that mission even the rest according to

 our state of life according to our results the Lord has blessed us with

 nothing is important for us to ask

 ourselves as we make the examination of

 conscience today have we really lived

 out our vocation it's a very important

 question because if we don't ask this

 question you will not only lead a life

 that is meaningful that is enriching

 here on this earth but you will end your

 life in regrets and so it's very

 important to ask ourselves leaving our life doing our work are we

 just trying to survive make some money

 he happy happy we'll enjoy is that what

 life is all about or do you have a sense

 of mission if you are married that is

 the mission you're single that is our

  mission do you see your whole life in other

 words as a mission that is very

 important because if you don't have this

 mission you cannot live your life with

 passion with meaning and purpose so what

 is your mission so do go through life as

 if you want years or is something I have

 to do it's not something you have to do

 or something all because you know I need

 some money or I need some company

 staying at homes of boring especially

 retired you know let me do something you

 know disturb some people make some

 people unhappy yeah I mean that is not

 the purpose of life this is the problem

 this is many of us when we are committed

 to our mission of vocation no problem

 for a short time to be in love in manage

 for 1-2 years

 okay but for 40 years that is a bit too

 much two years okay three years okay but

 after five years all the different thing

 after that we cannot spend each other

 reading in relationship over in work you

 know it's the same for every job that

 you take Oh

 three to three years you can give your

 best after that you begin to be

 complacent you begin to give up your

 passion why because sometimes they

 distracted along the way I always love

 this immediately that's another thing

 what race you know

 he says we are going to our destination

 along the way we see beautiful flowers

 and so we are enchanted by the flowers

 and we forget our destination and so

 it's a same thing -</c> you know some of you

 because and the special vocation I'll

 get a job because I'm free with some

 privileges some glory some honor you are

 happy and you forget your vocation your

 real mission is for God because you are

 focused on the material excellence even

 as we are enjoying what we are doing

 that is not forget that mission the end

 but I think for most people they give up

 the mission they lose the mission

 because of what is today in the first

 reading simple sports about the hours he

 was facing opposition he was having

 challenges in fact I think he suffered

 much more than anyone was small little

 things we get angry small little things

 to get upset look at sin all the

 persecutions that he has gone to any

 deity remain firm in this mission and

 that is true for us a little bit of

 problems we give up even for marriages

 some with the issues we can't see agree

 on everything we give up the

 relationship we don't have the

 sustenance and true you know working in

 a place we are dealing with human beings

 human beings with emotions with the

 powers with the values with the culture

 that they bring with the hang-ups as

 well if their own mindset we didn't

 leave or these kinds of people what is

 the key to be passionate in our ministry

 to be focused on mission

 three things we need to do firstly if

 simple was so committed in his mission

 the whole life and simple was driven by

 Jesus loved for him and he was a

 persecutor and you keep on everything

 this thing I was a persecutor and was

 the least to be chosen that the Apostles

 and God has chosen me so if you don't

 have that experience of being loved by

 Jesus I don't think you can sustain

 yourself I don't think you have a

 mission there is Mike

 some of you have most passion because my

 you are not driven by Jesus loved for

 you when you are loved by Jesus you just

 want to please thing we just want to

 glorify Him in Jesus again his whole

 life is motivated by what the fathers

 loved without the Father's love Jesus

 would not have given his old life do you

 have that first if you don't have that I

 think the work you are doing it becomes

 a chore it becomes something I have to

 do it becomes a big job you are hired

 worker I am one among you all I'm not a

 hard worker we are here because we have

 been loved by Jesus and we want to give

 us something that must be very clean

 that's the foundation of ministry that's

 the foundation of being involved in the

 mission of Jesus and secondly simple

 also has this idea or this experience

 not just being lost but he was

 a man with a clear conscience and it is

 very important to ask yourself do you

 have a clear conscience can you at the

 end of your life say in all conscience

 I've done my best as a parent in all

 conscience I've done my best as a

 collaborator of the Lord if you have a

 clear conscience

 let me tell you there is nothing to

 learn because it's not whether we are

 successful that is not a coin whether we

 are faithful to the mission if the Lord

 wants us to fail we will fail for him

 but provided we have done our best if

 there's not that anything see see

 failure the not wants me to feel

 different story you make it happen not

 because Jesus makes it happen but if we

 have done what we could have given our

 best there is nothing to regret

 this reason why to you as a bishop I

 have a vision I don't have ambition I

 don't have this vision I hope to be

 fulfilled but if this vision is not

 fulfilled I'm not going to go down to

 you know something many who are in the

 depression I would obviously be equally

 happy why should I not be because my

 conscience is clear I have done what the

 Lord has given to me I just give my best

 though my conscience is clear if you

 have a clear conscience like st.</c> Paul

 like Jesus then you be a happy person

 even when we face failures no issue but

 the question is have I even -</c> so those

 of you are parents you know sometimes

 parents also always feel very good I

 know something especially if parents you

 know you'd like to blame yourself you

 already spends too much time and look

 after them I gave my

 see my son said not to be like that my

 daughter like there you pray have I gone

 wrong nothing

 he's not gone wrong they have gone wrong

 what to do I mean everybody has a free

 will but I think the point is have you

 done your best if you had done your best

 if if the person was suppose that way

 there's nothing we can do except to pray

 there is no point to be there is no

 point to get angry the person and there

 is no point to blame yourself and

 finally I think this is important

 can you accept the plan of God

 you know simple we are told he says yes

 now you see me a prisoner already in

 spirit I'm on my way to Jerusalem but

 I've no idea what will happen to me

 except the Holy Spirit in town of the

 family has made it clear enough that

 imprisonment and persecution away to me

 he was not afraid

 he knew the sufferings were ahead of him

 and his you went ahead for the false in

 for all these sufferings will not deter

 him from giving in South evolution

 because he can accept the plan of God

 just as Jesus at the end of his life is

 surrendered his plan to the Father and

 so we should not be afraid so like

 simple we must be really to suffer

 really to accept the plan of work

 because we know that somehow God's plan

 will be successful perhaps not according

 to the way we assess it

 perhaps not according the way we want it

 to be done or the continuously and so

 that's why we take confidence we have

 hoped and if we do all these things then

 surely as what Jesus said we become the

  glue of the father and the glory of the

 father means simply that we too were

 radiant Jesus in the world as we give

 ourselves as the libation to the world

 as a self offering we find oneself we

 find own meaning we find own purpose and

 there is where happiness is all about at

 the end the day at the end the day to

 ask yourself really if you have given

 yourself for society for God for the

 church I can guarantee you your life

 will always be reached and meaningful

 and a life that has been reached well
