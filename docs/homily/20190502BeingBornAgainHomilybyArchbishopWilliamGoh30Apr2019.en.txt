What is it that actually make us happy in life? A life where there is joy, there is love,

there is generosity, where there is patience,
where there is kindness, these are the things that make life beautiful, that makes life happy. All the other things,

you know, pleasure, fun. All these things are meant to help us to enter into the life the Spirit, which is that of love and joy. So being baptised in Christ Jesus really is to put on Christ. It is to share in the life of the Spirit that Jesus has promised as. The way to lfe is to really empty ourselves for the service of others. The way to leave is to live for others. The way to love ourselves is to love others.  The way to make ourselves happy is to make others happy . Whatever God has given to us, it is for the service of others.  We  are stewards.

We are not owners, we are stewards. Yes we need to make use of whatever we need, but then we also need to reach out to those who are also in need because we are brothers and sisters.
