 how much you give yourself to Jesus will

 determine how saved you are doing God's

 will is the ultimate sacrifice the most

 difficult thing is doing gospel when it

 is difficult when it goes against your

 grain when you really have to say yes

 thy will be done and Jesus shows us

 could be but if you do God's will you

 are a beast your conscience is here if

 you can surrender yourself to do the

 Father's will you are the happiest

 person that's why you become the mother

 the brothers and the sisters of Jesus

 you become like Jesus at every step we

 must be discerning is this what God

 wants me to do when you come to know

 what is gospel for you then you must

 pray for the desire to do God's will and

 when you do it you find peace
