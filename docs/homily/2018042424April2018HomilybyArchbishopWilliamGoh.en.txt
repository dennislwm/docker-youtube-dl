 so in the gospel we have the Jews who

 gathered around Jesus and asked him how

 much longer are you gonna keep us in

 suspense if you are the Christ tell us

 plainly this is a very important

 question to address ourselves who is

 Jesus to rest and that is the reason why

 this question identity becomes important

 in the early church they did not have an

 identity as yet and we are to the

 persecution cost them to be scattered to

 go out of Jerusalem and so we are told

 they went about preaching the good news

 and as a result many were converted it

 is significant that it is only through

 the persecution and through the lack of

 acceptance by the Jews they begin to

 cultivate or begin to reflect on the own

 identity how they were different than

 the Jews and that is why we are -</c> it was

 then that they were called Christians

 the disciples of Jesus and so today we

 are asked to reflect on own identity how

 is this identity as Christians can be

 reinforced it depends on our own

 knowledge of Jesus even though many of

 us we are following the teachings we are

 reading the Bible we are praying but

 because of our lack of intimacy with the

 Lord we do not really listen to him and

 that is why we cannot say we know him in

 the gospel we are taught jesus said the

 father and I are one

 Jesus was conscious of his identity as

 son of the father because he was in deep

 communion with him his thoughts his will

 they were one with the father and so it

 is important for us this morning

 as we want to discover own identity we

 need to ask ourselves are we really the

 ship of Jesus how much to be listen to

 him it is only when we listen to Jesus

 when we in communing with Jesus then we

 become receptive to his words receptive

 to his works so at the end of the day it

 is important for us to realize that it

 is in our community with one another

 that we will be able to gain confidence

 from each other it is how much we

 communicate with one another how much we

 share with each other so that the works

 we do the people can recognize that they

 are works of love this that were enables

 to strengthen our identity and so this

 morning let's pray and that we will be

 able to deepen our unit of Jesus so that

 we can be one with each other
