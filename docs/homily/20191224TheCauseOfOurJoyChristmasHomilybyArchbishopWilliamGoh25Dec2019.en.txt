  they injure said the north be afraid

 listen I bring you news of great joy a

 joy to be shared by the whole people my

 dear brothers and sisters we gather here

 this evening tonight to celebrate joy

 but what is the cause of this joy who is

 the cause of this joy who will bring us

 true joy you know my dear brothers and

 sisters Christmas is celebrated all over

 the world even by people without failed

 or even those from other religions but

 many people in the world celebrate

 Christmas it is a day a night of fun and

  merrymaking and they are just celebrating if you

 were to ask them why are you celebrating

 because everyone is celebrating they're

 not celebrating because they know what

 they are celebrating about it is the

 time for them to make merry but it is

 just a reprieved because once the night

 is over then they go back to the old way

 of life the joy is a limited joy and for

 some it can be a cause of greater misery

 because of the way they celebrate of

 course we have goodwill people as the

 angel said peace to all men of goodwill

 goodwill people who celebrated this

 festival even though they do not know

 the reason but at least they share the

 common values of Christmas which

 celebrates giving

 and loving and being inclusive and so

 they find it a meaningful celebration

 but again the question comes back what

 is the cause of this celebration they

 don't have the answer for us Christians

 who celebrate this festival our answer

 is clear the cause of our joy is not

 simply because we are celebrating it

 just because of fund of merrymaking

 we're not celebrating it to create

 artificial joy but rather the

 celebration comes from a joy that is

 deep within our hearts and this joy

 comes from the very fact that we are

 celebrating the God who has emptied

 himself to become and he is called

 Emmanuel God who assumes our humanity

 and dick flashed in our midst we are

 celebrating not just amend who is born a

 man who is truly God as the angel said I

 come to announce to you this evening he

 said a savior has been born he is Christ

 the Lord so my dear brothers and sisters

 we are celebrating Jesus who is God and

 mend and who is our Savior my dear

 brothers and sisters how do we know that

 this celebration is indeed effective and

 meaningful is Jesus truly the cause of

 our joy in other words because I can

 tell you my dear brothers and sisters

 even as we gathered here this evening

 even though there is loss of merrymaking

 there are many of us here who deeply in

 our hearts we don't really feel joyful

 there is no real peace in our hearts we

 can be smiling we can be laughing but we

 know that we are carrying so much burden

 in us are your hearts at peace this

  evening have you been reconciled with your

 fellow man with your loved ones have

 been reconciled with your children who

 have left you have you been reconciled

 with your good friend who have

 misunderstood you if you have not been

 reconciled then there is no peace then

 there are so many of you here who are

 going through difficult times in life

 you might be suffering from a terminal

 illness you might have lost your job

 you're in financial difficulties maybe

 able to take care of your elderly or

 even your children who are mentally

 challenged physically challenged we have

 all these burdens to carry so how can we

 say therefore that this is truly a

 season of joy and peace that Christ has

 come to give us peace so my dear

 brothers and sisters it is important

 therefore when we celebrate this

 festival they must really mean it that

 Jesus is really the one who brings us

 peace and laughed and joy as today in

 the first reading we are told a

 wonderful counselor mighty God the

 Prince of Peace indeed in the first

 reading we are told the people walking

 in darkness and they has seen a great

 light the people of Israel they were

 living under the threat of the Assyrian

 Empire they were living in gloom and

 doomed and they were just hoping that

 they could

 be saved from their enemies and isiah

 assured them that the Messiah will come

 in oh man dear brothers and sisters how

 does the Messiah come into our lives

 this evening so it's very important once

 again to understand the course of our

 joy we must go back to the origin of our

 joy because we still can have joy and

 peace not because there are no

 sufferings true peace and joy comes from

 God and these peace and joy that comes

 from God will be with us even when we

 are suffering the sufferings the joy of

 the world is a joy without suffering

 that is a worldly joy Christian joy is a

 joy that suffers and able to suffer

 means that you are capable of loved if

 we are not able to suffer this because

 we lack the capacity to loved anyone who

 loves will suffer only those who love

 themselves make others suffer but if

 we'd love others we would suffer and

 will our suffering would be one of joy

 and one of peace you know even when the

 whole world is against you because you

 are doing something right because some

 people are jealous of you some people

 are envious of you if you know you're

 doing the will of God even if there are

 people who slander you who go against

 you who try to hinder you from bringing

 about changes you're at peace because

 God is you're pissed because you are

 doing the will of God

 so in on my dear brothers and sisters

 where do we draw strength to remain

 joyful even in our difficult moments

 this is why today Christmas we want to

 remember that this goal is the Emanuel

 he is with us the Church invites us to

 contemplate on this God who is not far

 away he is not at a distance he is a man

 because in all things we don't sinned

 every pain every sorrow every suffering

 every rejection every betrayer every

 burdened he has carried in his body so

 don't say that you are suffering alone

 don't say that no one understands you

 don't say that God does not understand

 how much do you are going through if

 only you know how much the Lord has gone

 through in assuming our humanity that's

 the reason why at Christmas we celebrate

 the God who comes in his loneliness he

 is born in a stable he reaches out first

 to the poor shepherds to the uneducated

 not the powerful not the reached not

 those who stain a Palast no barriers

 between Jesus and this he wants to live

 in the midst of his people so that you

 will know that God knows how much we are

 suffering so that when you look at him

 you look at Jesus who suffers you can

 find strength and this is true in life

 sometimes you know we find so difficult

 to carry on but if we look at someone

 who suffers patiently joyfully we say we

 want to be like this percent

 someone who could be our mentor a role

 model in carrying the suffering of loved

 Jesus is not just the Emmanuelle he is

 the light of the world that is why the

 opening prayer speak of Jesus the light

 of the world that is why we celebrate

 Christmas midnight mass midnight mass

 because the world is in darkness and

 which is true today you know many people

 are living their lives without direction

 this is what is happening in the world

 people do not know who they are anymore

 people do not know what they are living

 for they just going through life like we

 just eating drinking sleeping having fun

 work this all is going on and on and on

 but what are their living for they do

 not know they do not know who are you

 they also do not know they do not know

 about the agenda they do not know who

 they are are you a man are you a human

 being they also do not know so what you

 do on this earth they also do not know

 and when you die what will happen D they

 also do not know they see we are just

 here and we will disappear and this is

 the whole pot filler how can you live

 your life like that

 we don't go with our destiny without

 knowing your identity that is right

 today in the face of relativism the

 whole world is confused today we are

 trying to normalize what is abnormal

 nothing today's abnormal everything is

  normal there is no evil that is why Jesus the

 light of the world he is the word of God

 he's the one who shows us the truth he's

 the one who shows us our true identity

 called Jesus is the Son of God he shows

 us what it means to be a son a daughter

 of God and that is who we are

 those who know Jesus

 they become God's sons and daughters

 because they begin to leave the kind of

 light that Jesus has taught them how to

 lift this right Jesus is the light and

 we are told in the second reading of

 Titus he sacrificed himself so that

 together with him

 we are waiting in hope for the blessing

 which will come with the appearing of

 the glory of our God and Savior Jesus

 Christ honestly my dear brothers and

 sisters the life that we have on this

 table is very short very short and today

 with a very fast-moving world you do not

 know now you look 40 but you close your

 eye who becomes 60 ready very fast today

 the world is moving real fast before you

 know I will be celebrating your funeral

 it's very fast and then working to do

 that is why we don't live only for this

 world unfortunately people are living

 only for this world that is what the

 euro are saying you only live once you

 only live once and they live only for

 this world poor fellows ultimately we

 live for eternity that is why even

 though when we go through difficult

 times in this life on this earth it is

 shorter compared to eternity

 it is short do you live for eternity

 vividly for eternity you will take your

 life seriously today that's the whole

 problem when people forget that there is

 this eternal life that is waiting for

 them they do not take this life

 seriously they wish this life that the

 Lord has given to them when we speak of

 Christmas of course we are reminded of

 the love of God that God has given not

 just as something you know at Christmas

 we only give some gifts gives our

 external gears we can buy

 but there is no greater gift than the

 gift of yourself so the best Christmas

 present is not just presents

 it's your presence your presence is the

 most beautiful gift you can give to

 anyone your presence means your time

 your love your devotion your attention

 yourself so is very simple give a

 present and get rid of your tangata the

 president cost $50 I can get rid of you

 but when you give yourself is a

 different thing and God did not come to

 give us any presents he came to give us

 nothing less than himself and his life

 and what is the purpose of life at the

 end of all that we are living for you

 know my dear brothers and sisters no

 matter who you are search yourself you

 know it the only reason why we lived is

 for love there is no other meaning

 living for power for glory for status

 all these illusions power glory wealth

 all these things they cannot make you

 happy but you will be happy when you are

 in loved you'll be happy when you know

 that you are loved you'll be happy when

 you know you're capable of loved that is

 the whole meaning of life and that is

 why God became men in order to teach us

 how to love to give us the capacity to

 loved and finally my dear brothers and

 sisters as we celebrate Christmas we say

 Christmas is to give us peace peace do

 you have peace no one is the real

 problem for many of you if you are not

 finding peace and if there is no peace

 in this world do you know what is the

 real problem because when we think of

 peace people only thing in terms of

 horizontal peace peace among men among

 brothers and sisters peace with my

 spouse peace with my children

 piece with the rest of society and we

 all try to work for peace we try to

 dialogue and look at the world today the

 world is still divided there is still no

 peace of course they law all these

 things they are very important for peace

 but in themselves alone they cannot

 bring peace what is it that is lacking

 is the vertical piece not the horizontal

 if he's busy because man is cut off from

 God when men rebelled against God when

 men is not reconciled with God he has no

 peace in himself when there is no peace

 in yourself that is why you create

 problems then you will not be at peace

 with your brothers and your sisters and

 with the rest of nature the bottom line

 actually is because man is not at peace

 with God if you are at peace with God

 I can guarantee you you will be at peace

 with yourself when you at peace with

 yourself you don't find for the people

 you don't make people angry don't

 irritate people you don't fight with

 people a man who is at peace he will

 give peace let there be peace on earth

 let it begin to with me so if you are

 looking for peace and you cannot find

 peace and I can tell you reason why

 because you are not reconciled with God

 that is why for those of you who have

 not made the sacrum reconciliation for a

 long time let me tell you let me

 guarantee you you can make a good

 sacrament of reconciliation when you

 find peace in your heart then you begin

 to see everything in life in perspective

 all your hatred anger for your enemies

 will go because there is no peace in

 your heart that is why Jesus came to

 reconcile us with God only then we could

 be reconciled

 we one another so we know my dear

 brothers and sisters this is the good

 news this is the cause of our great joy

 that we are celebrating this evening let

 us be like the Shepherd let us be like

 the mean giant let us be like Mary let

 us give Jesus a place in our hearts

 let us continue to contemplate and to

 wonder wonder there is why you notice at

 Christmas we have a Christmas crib baby

 Jesus just of infant child Jesus

 Christmas is so beautiful it's not just

 sentimental but it really brings us to

 wonder how could God become man so

 innocent so vulnerable in order to

 tosha's in order to move us to true joy

 and peace
