As we celebrate the Feast of St Bartholomew, one of the most important lessons we can learn from him is to remove our prejudices in life. We do not see things as they are. We see things as we are. All our experiences of the past will determine the way we look at situations,
the way we look at people. And that is the reason why we all react differently to different situations because of our past experience. That makes us all biased. So these impressions that we have can really affect the way we look at life. Life is not all logic.

Explanations, arguments alone cannot win people over. We are influenced mostly by what we experience. So if you want to change people's lives and perception, there is nothing like helping a person to enter into the experience. Otherwise, if you just base on logic alone, we come to nowhere. A person is converted not because of some ethical thought, because of some lofty ideas, but an encounter with an event,

and the event is Jesus, because faith is more than just reasoning. Faith is an encounter. All of us, as I've , we are biased, but let me be open to new experiences. Be adventurous. When you love, when you are not hurt, we tend to see goodness in people. If you want to love more, if you want to understand a person more, if you want to see the goodness in a person more,
then we need to remove this prejudice and ask the Lord for the grace, that sincerity, that openness and taking the risk of believing, taking the risk of trusting. So if your loved ones have lost Jesus, you have to find ways and means, how to help them to encounter the Jesus event. That is all. Once that is done, the rest will follow.
