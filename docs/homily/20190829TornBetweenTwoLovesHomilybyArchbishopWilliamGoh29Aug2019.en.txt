Everybody needs love. Everybody needs some kind of security. In such a situation, my way is to bring a person closer to God. Let the person come to fall in love with Jesus and then let the Lord speak to the person.
Let the Lord enlighten the person. Let the Lord help the person to make a decision, so that the person will be at peace. If we do not choose the Lord, yes, we might not be hurt there and then. But later on when the situation becomes worse, we look back, we might not be able to forgive ourselves. Let us pray for God's grace to be able to see the bigger picture, see the long term implications and to search for authentic happiness. Don't just seek for short term happiness or apparent happiness.
