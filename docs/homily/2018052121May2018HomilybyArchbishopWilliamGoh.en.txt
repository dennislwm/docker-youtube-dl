 Meiri when we address her as the market

 church what are we doing first and

 foremost we are putting Mary on the same

 level as us to call Mary the mother

 church is the most EQ manacle title

 because very often we can't accept in

 accused of putting Mary closer to God

 that is not true Mary is the creature

 like any one of us Mary is with the

 church Mary belongs to the church Mary

 was redeemed by Christ as we are

 redeemed Mary was the recipient of

 Christ and therefore tooting marry on

 the same level of the church means that

 we place may be on our side so that is

 why it's important to underscore that

 Mary herself was a recipient of grace

 and we do receive the same grace we do

 can grow in holiness but Mary's not

 simply part of the church Mary's also

 the principal partager that is to say

 the highest ROI that any Christian can

 arrived she is the example of what it

 means to be a disciple of Christ so to

 put Mary as the mother church it means

 to say she is that point that we all

 want to arrive at Mary in the American

  South shows that if we live the life of grace

 and leave in place we do can be wholly

 married in a batch of virginity tells us

 how we can be faithful to Christ being

 singular minded in serving the Lord and

 in serving the people of God merely

 standing at the foot of the cross

 teaches us how to forgive how to let go

 how to love our enemies how to suffer

 with Christ for Christ for the salvation

 of humanity Mary in her assumption gives

 us the hope that we live the life of

 grace we do a share in the same glory of

 Christ fullness of life that is why Mary

 is the mother of the church she is the

 one who is on our side she's our mother

 she's our sister and she is the one that

 business so today as we shall be

 dismissed that is pray that we would be

 like Mary we also will cooperate with

 the grace even tourists in Christ if

 Mary became the mother of Jesus it was

 because as an Augustine always reminded

 Miss Mary conceived Jesus in her heart

 before she conceived Jesus in the flesh

 and so if we like Mary if we bring Jesus

 to Allah we do work in our own very

 becomes Jesus to others and become

 mothers sisters and brothers to one

 another
