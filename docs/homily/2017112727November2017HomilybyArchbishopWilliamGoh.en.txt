 Munir brothers and sisters in Christ we

 are reminded of the need to be generous

 with our money with our resources and to

 give them to God the Widow's mite story

 is to anticipate Jesus total surrender

 of his entire life of his body of his

 spirit to the Father we invited to

 follow Jesus in giving our lives

 completely for the service of the

 kingdom of God we by virtue of baptism

 we are cool to share Jesus kingship by

 building a kingdom of love of justice of

 compassion of charity whatever the Lord

 has given to rest not just money

 resources time our job our career

 whatever we had they must be used for

 the building of God's kingdom of loved

 only those of us who have faith in Jesus

 faith in God can surrender our whole

 life to the service of God for the good

 of others for the love and the glory of

 a handi father if we have faith in Him

 if we have the courage to surrender

 o that we have

 the Lord will make use of us in ways

 beyond our imagination we surrender

 whatever little we have like the widow

 and the law will transform them into

 things that we can use for the good of

 everyone
