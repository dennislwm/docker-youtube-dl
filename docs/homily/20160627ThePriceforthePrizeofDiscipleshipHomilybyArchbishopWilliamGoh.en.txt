 today's gospel is similar to Easter this

 gospel the only difference is that the

 day the gospel is taken from sin Matthew

 and they speak about the call of side

 Bishop to this gospel helps us to

 understand the same of Sigma as gospel

 which we read yesterday we are told that

 in same Agnes gospel what the scribes

 came up to him and said master I will

 follow you wherever you go and jesus

 replied father said holes and burst the

 nest of the air have nests but the Son

 of man has nowhere to live he said I

 think the great thing about Jesus is

 that he is very candid with his would-be

 disciples those who want to follow him

 he does not promise then rose talent and

 he is very open with his would-be

 disciples the consequences the

 sacrifices in following him certainly he

 did not preach a good life gospel

 prosperity gospel but truly the gospel

 that he preaches is the gospel of true

 freedom and it is interesting and indeed

 I think Jesus must have been truly

 inspiring because the old people's the

 one who asked to follow him was

 described in the scribes are legalistic

 and he himself was inspired by Jesus of

 course we know that the very beginning

 gospel Jesus saw the great crowds all

 about him it's important therefore that

 when we want to follow Jesus this man a

 freely wants to follow him and when you

 want to follow Jesus then we discouraged

 you but when you don't want to follow

 Jesus then because him he's a funny

 fellow huh because the second man said

 sir let me go and bury my father first

 Jesus says follow me and lifted it to

 bury it did so on one hand we have

 enthusiasm so the first man full of

 enthusiasm wanted to follow Jesus and

 Jesus helped him to see things in

 perspective the other one he was

 enthusiastic but so so so so Jesus says

 you follow me now now this is important

 for us because very often many people

 they want to find fullness of life but

 they are not ready to follow Jesus

 really so even for many Catholics they

 are baptized but how many really intend

 to be disciples of Jesus the disciples

 of Jesus really needs to be aware of the

 sacrifices but hate of us it means

 really a call to die to self and it is

 true that Jesus had nowhere to lay his

 head because the full universe is his

 house is very open very active very

 available and that is why Jesus reminds

 us the importance of this portal ability

 and so today in the gospel we have

 reminded that know for discipleship we

 are called to be ready to make that

 sacrifice of holding him and that was

 the reason also in the first reading

 where we are told that the people of God

 according the Prophet Amos although they

 were the chosen people of God they did

 not observe the covenantal walls instead

 of practicing justice they were actually

 cheating each other and those who were

 in charge the leaders especially the

 world robbing the people meeting the

 chosen people of God is not enough until

 we also live that life and so this is

 where I think for us as church we need

 to really ask to know how many disciples

 we have in the Catholic Church so many

 we have so many great crowds but few

 follow Jesus

 unfortunately if you take their

 Christian life seriously and to take our

 Christian life seriously Jesus tells us

 in the gospel is to put God at the

 center of our mind you know when this

 man said to Jesus let me go and bury my

 father first it doesn't mean that the

 father has already died not yet

 most likely okay so this is follow me

 lift the date to bury the dead

 this is interesting because it is

 important because Jesus is not

 advocating not really filial piety for

 parents but it's a question of

 priorities is a question of focus and I

 always believe and this is very

 important and in our relationship as

 well while Shirin whatever it is is got

 the center of your life I think that is

 most important God is the center of your

 life everything will have its place but

 when something else takes the center of

 your life then you are totally out of

 focus that's really so important the

 responsible some mark these you would

 never think of God so what is important

 for us is to

 see all things from the perspective of

 price so you press the center of your

 life whatever we do they will always be

 for the people that we love when Christ

 on the center of our life then the

 person becomes our possession the person

 becomes the one that we mentally so it's

 true a parent should love their children

 but sometimes I don't think parents are

 really loving their children you have to

 be loving yourself of development

 security possessiveness and therefore we

 don't do what is right for children so

 if we speak God as a center then we know

 how we should best love our spouse our

 children our parents and this is very

 true especially one please if Jesus is

 not the center of their life then the

 ministry becomes a center other things

 become the center then he loses his

 perspective so for me in all that I do I

 ask you know whether Jesus is that

 center in Jesus the center in the human

 relationship then the relationship will

 grow or flourish will blossom because

 the couple becomes more loving more

 caring more forgiving and Jesus when

 Jesus saw the center then you depend on

 your own love I loved you you loved me

 but that will not last long because then

 our love is insecure all of his net

 equate he would not the capacity so

 Jesus is awesome

 a step walk into this gospel if you want

 to follow him it is more than gives our

 enthusiasm but we really need to put him

 the Center for life and so this is where

 we are called to respond
