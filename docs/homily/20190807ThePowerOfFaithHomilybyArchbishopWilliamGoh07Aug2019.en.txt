If you want to make great achievements in life, if you want to carry out what God has called us to do, if you want to fulfill your plans, then it's important that it is not enough just to have faith in oneself. We need to have faith in God.

And this is what pleases God, and this is what give us the confidence to persevere and to continue to hold on to our dreams.
Without faith, our dreams will be rather limited. Without faith, we will not be able to take risks (impossible risks), then we tend to be very rationalistic, very logical. Very often, we don't do great things, because of fear, because we are afraid that we will not be able to accomplish. God is always stretching our faith. To have faith, you need to have humility, you need to recognise your nothingness, you need to recognise that you are dependent on God. Without humility, no faith is possible. When you are able to have faith, you are able to see beyond your perspective. Faith is dependent on humility, but faith is also dependent on love. And love helps us to persevere. So it is love that sustains hope. If you find that you give up hope,

it is because you are without love. So hope,
actually, that someone who is in need can be helped, that's why you hope. But this hope must be sustained by love. So that is why, you know, the three theological virtues -

Faith, Hope and Charity. Hope is always the middle.

Because of hope, that is why this hope sustains your faith, this hope sustains your love.
