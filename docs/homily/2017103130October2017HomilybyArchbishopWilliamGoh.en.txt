 why is he that many of us do not find

 life we are not happy in what we are

 doing in the life that we lived there is

 only one reason it is before we live

 under some form of slavery there are two

 kinds of slavery that prevent us from

 leaving the fullness of life the first

 form of slavery is a slavery and to

 ourselves slavery because of sin whoever

 is a slave to his passion remains

 unhappy the second form of slavery when

 they are slaves to the law some of us

 are always fearful of breaking the laws

 for them the laws are more important

 than life

 the laws are more important than people

 and so what is the way to overcome this

 slavery we must allow the Spirit of God

 to live in us to be moved by the spirit

 watch movie with us in life is always

 loved now brings us joy when you know

 that God is your Abba Father then you

 will be able to surrender your

 to him surrender no worries

 surrender your anxieties surrender your

 fears because your fears your anxieties

 make you a slave so today we take

 confidence in our law because the law

 was to heal us he will not prolong our

 suffering unnecessary because God is

 Allah
