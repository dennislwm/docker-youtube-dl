 at the end of today's first reading from

 the extra divorces st.</c> Peter said this

 is the stone rejected by you the

 builders but which has proved to be the

 keystone for of all the names in the

 world given to men this is the only one

 I wished we can be saved these

 proclamations of Peter that Jesus is the

 unique one the only savior of humanity

 truly was a bold declaration that must

 have taken lots of courage and

 conviction it is faith in the

 resurrection that is the basis for their

 Proclamation how could a man who was

 condemned as a criminal and be raised to

 the date the fact that he was alive it

 means therefore to say all the claims of

 Jesus of who he washed his identity his

 mission that he came from the Father all

 this became true we cannot make this

 declaration unless we ourselves

 encountered the reason how can we be

 sure that Jesus is the reason Lord and

 therefore the savior of all men firstly

 we are told the disciples were

 transformed they were uneducated they

 were cowards they were running away from

 Romans and there they stood before the

 same evil the second factor we are toys

 the man who was crippled has been raised

 and beaten John knew they had no power

 they were just ordinary men who could

 actually scripted men so they knew if

 Jesus was not reason how could this man

 be healed and it's important to take

 note the reason law is a transform not

 it's not the same that's why when he

 appeared they could quite nicely so

 Jesus have to give signs that he is

 somebody have this gospel we have to

 what we call the miracle of the fish

 this is a repetition of the first one

 John and Peter remembered the first man

 when the miracle happened and the second

 what we call indication that he was the

 reason Lord and I was abducted pray they

 remember it must be bought we must be

 the lord and of course the bread and the

 fish time the fish of course is a very

 beautiful way of summing up what st.</c>


Peter proclaimed in the first reading

 there is no other name by which we can

 be saved because the word the Greek word

 for fish is to that I see th us I yes

 you see for crystals Jesus Christ

 th is a osteons miss god and who knows

 who uses mean son and then the last one

 is s s win Savior Savior

 so Jesus Christ son of God Savior so

 that is why and the word fish is about

 symbol for us Christine to use to

 declare Jesus Christ son of God savior

 of the world that is the ultimate

 profession of faith and so when we say

 that Jesus is the Lord and Savior all

 humanity it is an offer of faith it's an

 invitation for those who have not

 encountered Jesus to become an encounter

 him if you encounter Jesus that perhaps

 your views will change your personal

 conviction will change
