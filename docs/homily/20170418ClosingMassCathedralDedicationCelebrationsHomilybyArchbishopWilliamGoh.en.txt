 my dear brothers and sisters in Christ

 in the first reading the Easter light

 said the Lord has abandoned me the Lord

 has forgotten me my dear friends these

 are very strong words very poignant

 words addressed God both of you who are

 parents will them to understand if one

 day your children with a say these same

 words to you you have forgotten me you

 have abandoned me my dear brothers and

 sisters these words were pierce your

 heart my dear brothers and sisters we

 can understand where the easter lights

 were coming from they were in exile they

 lost the land their Kingdom and their

 camp own they lost everything and there

 were some good people and they felt that

 God had abandoned them when we got

 restore our fortunes

 restore the land and that is why out of

 their hearts they cried out to God why

 have you abandoned us and I'm sure my

 dear brothers and sisters all of us we

 do feel with the East realize how often

 in our lives how many times you also had

 said the same things to the Lord why

 have you forgotten me

 why have you abandoned me those times

 when you were suffering because of an

 illness because of betrayer because of

 in financial difficulties because you

 lost a job because you are suffering

 under difficult people in your life and

 then you asked where is God this is a

 very natural question because we expect

 God to be the average especially in our

 struggles in life and if you are going

 through difficult times we need to feel

 that he is with us and we're still in

 these difficult times that would be

 Catholics who will come to tell you God

 is love God is near us he has human he

 has answered my prayers

 he has given me the fortune to strike

 for thee everybody is fractally except

 you that's the whole problem he is my

 dear brothers and sisters and you wonder

 how is it that God is merciful to

 everyone except you and that is why we

 become angry we go

 we become resentful that these goal is

 good to everyone they have encountered

 him they have seen him them experiencing

 but we haven't that is why many people

 begin to wonder is God real and Musa

 when you live in a secular society today

 when God is absent from public life when

 the sacred is no longer felt in our

 means how can there be our loving God when your brothers and sisters if you

 feel that God has abandoned you that is

 not the worst thing even the church the

 house of God the family of God also have

 abandoned you those time when you need

 help moves when you were in bereavement

 and the church was not there for you the

 priests were not available when your

 loved ones was sick in hospital when

 your loved one passed away no one from

 the Catholic community came to support

  you those times and you were down in out

 when you are falling into depression

 everybody tried to stay away from you

 you became a nuisance they are fair

 where their friends only when you are

 good when you are healthy when you can

 contribute then the kind of community

 welcomes you otherwise no you know when

 the church betrays you and abandons you

 it makes you wonder

 is the church real are the people

 interest really truly worshiping Christ

 and encountered you I also do you

 explain the scandalous behavior of

 priests religious leaders laity and if

 the church have abandoned you at least

 you would think your family your friends

 would have stood with you in your trance

 even family members bent and you and it

 gets even more painful to know that your

 parents or your spouse are so active in

 church very supportive but not at home but dichotomy between faith and life and

 that makes you even more angry with God

 that this God have taken away your loved

 ones and the conclusion therefore is all

 are hypocrites yes my dear brothers and

 sisters that is why we can feel with the

 years realized when they said the Lord

 has abandoned me the Lord has forgotten

 you but the Word of God tells us that

 this is not the case that is why when

 God heard these words his immediate

 response was wonderful

 he says like those of your parents if

 you have given your life to your

 children you work hard you sacrifice

 your cry

 you'll labor in the house you have to go

 to work you have to under money come

 back and continue to tuition your

 children and do everything for your

 children and give them everything and it

 turned against you and say you have

 abandoned me you have forgotten me I

 know how your parents feel because

 sometimes this is how we priests feel as

 well let me tell you we please give our

 whole life the service of the people we

 are not paid every minute every day

 everything we have is for the service of

 the people of God and people turn

 against us and said you have abandoned

 me you have forsaken me that's why the

 Lord said does a woman forget her baby

 at the breast or fail to cherish the son

 of a wound this is unthinkable no parent

 no mother would abandoned her son but

 the law says even if that happens I will

 not abandoned you even if these forget I

 will not forget you you all know very

 well my dear friends those of you who

 are women those of you one modest no

 matter how naughty your child is so

 irresponsible how ungrateful they are

 they can be Rascals criminals you will

 still love them you will never give up

 on them because they come from your womb because of this attachment this love for

 your children you do anything and God is

 like that

 this when to this gospel Jesus said look

 at creation look at the birds look at

 the flowers look at the palms

 I look after them all and you know my

 dear brothers and sisters we are worth

 more than sparrows and birds although

 this is the year of the rooster we are

 work more than Audis we are children of

 God that is why in John 3:16 Saint John said

 for God so loved the world he gave His

 only Son so that those who believe in

 Him might not perish but have eternal

 life you know my dear brothers and

 sisters Jesus is our good shot this

 Cathedral is named precisely after Jesus

 the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd who

 lays down his life for his shaved The

 Good Shepherd who seeks for the lost

 sheep every sheep is important those who

 are lost also in girdles are wounded

 those are broken and those who are

 strong the Lord makes you stronger every

 shift is important to the Lord he came

 to give us live life abundantly at the

 cost of his own life so don't say the

 Lord has forgotten me the Lord has

 abandoned me it hurts the Lord because

 he has even everything is even His only

 Son and Jesus given his entire life and

 still we can say the Lord has forgotten

 to me it grieves the Heart of Jesus

 to hear these words simply because the

 gospel tells us you meant of litter

 faved you meant of little faith and that

 is why in the light of what we have

 heard what must we do my dear brothers

 and sisters st.</c> Paul tells us in today's

 second reading people must think of us

 as Christ's servants and trusted with

 the mysteries of God it means to say

 from now on we will receive the

 mysteries of God we will receive

 salvation the good news the Word of God

 we have encountered Jesus we need to be

 his servants to be servants of the

 mystery of God what does it mean the

 word mystery translated from the Greek

 word is in stereo and and Latin

 translate the word mysterion as

 sacramentum the word mystery means the

 plan of God that has been revealed in

 Jesus the word mystery means to say we

 are called to be signs of Jesus so to be

 stewards of God's mystery means to say

 all of us who have been given these

 mysteries must now be the sign of God's

 presence in the world the channels of

 His grace of his love and His mercy the

 gratitude of having received His mercy that is why my dear brothers and sisters

 the church the cathedral and all

 churches included we must be the hope a

 sign of hope for Humanity

 today many people are living in this

 live eat sleep work and joy mcmoney and

 I and then where do they go nowhere they

 don't know where they don't believe in

 God that's the end of life finish

 finished so us how's your dad finished

 gone he's disappeared but for us we know

 we know what I will we know what we are

 living for we are living for eternity

 not just in the next world now when we

 share the life of Christ when we give

 our lives in love in service this is the

 meaning of life this is what gives you

 purposeful living that is what we need

 today but also living do you have a

 purpose in life

 if you don't have a purpose in life you

 can never be happy no matter how old

 rich you are how successful you are you

 will never find happiness unless you

 have a real purpose in life no matter

 how old are you you can be young it can

 be 80 years old you can be on the

 wheelchair you must have a purpose in

 life you must live for someone live for

 God live for love be a sign of God's

 presence of hope to others even when you

 are sick in bed you still can be a hold

 by the way we suffer but we endure the

 cross the church must be of home as I

 have said at the beginning of this

 dedication a home for everyone rich poor

 young Oh

 Shirin I just received a letter

 complaining to me some churches are not

 bothering the children some relief

 people cannot bother it

 a little bit of noise they want to

 complain if that is so I want to send a

 letter to your house because your

 children making the mass noise in your

 house make sure your children from today

 onwards don't cry don't buckle up

 because it disturbs your peace at home

 come on to the children

 me to say the church is alive a place

 for everyone whatever sexual orientation

 you have whatever race color language

 culture migrants the church is a home

 for everyone because simply we are the

 family of God is the father of all

 irrespective saints or sinners they all

 belong to the Father

 we don't exclusiveness because they too

 are searching for God they do our

 welcome all our welcome that is our

 entrancing all our welcome the church

 must also be precisely a place of mercy

 and the most important mercy is to

 encounter the mercy of God that's why I

 ask you my dear brothers and sister pray

 for me and pray with me I hope that one

 day this Cathedral will be able to offer

 the sacrament of reconciliation every

 day during the day for all those of you

 who are seeking for God's mercy but I

 need priests

 if the priest don't come I can't be

 sitting at many for hours I got what to

 do but you know the sacrament of

 reconciliation is such a beautiful

 sacrament not just only to have priests

 to hear confession I want you to pray

 that there will be confessors who are

 compassionate understanding forgiving

 because sometimes confessors can put

 this off you get the wrong confessor

 that was with that with the end of your

  confession no more confession merci a place of Mercy Mercy also in

 terms of reaching up to those who are

 poor those who are in need of material

 help physical help and also the rich

 poor because I tell you all of you here

 are very rich and also very poor I was

 reading the papers this morning about us

 some song you know the son arrested will

 think they are so reached and the

 daughter committed suicide at age of 26

 rich family and the happy did not happy

 they have all the money no more look at

 their life are they happy you can be

 reached but their poor poor in love were

 in encountering a lot of God they're not

 happy people like this no money very

 happy you can even tell me afterwards

 I'll go the Republic at it one fan me

 nice nice happy happy here

 chip chip chip chip happy happy ah no

 need to worry you don't need to be some

 song gee if we don't need to be ah my

 dear brothers and sisters it's not only

 a place of mercy make this also into the

 place where this is a place of worship

 Jesus says my house must be a house of

 prayer this is again my prayer please

 pray for me I want to make this

 cathedral truly a place of prayer we

 have the Perpetual Adoration room but

 that is not enough I want to bring

 worship to this place the Eucharist of

 course the -</c> your celebration but not

 only that prayer meetings I want this

 place to be vibrant rich in prayer

 private prayer personal prayer community

 prayer because only prayer can change

 these diocese and change the world

 that is also mine desire make this into

 a house of breath where people can

 encounter God and know that God is real

 finally make this place my dear brothers

 and sisters into the place of fellowship

 in the life is not just all work and all

 prayer is also play must have some fund

 no finally need to have friends we need

 to have a community to support us so

 that those times when we feel abandoned

 and we feel lonely Jesus is there the

 worst thing my dear brothers and sisters

 and I can tell you honestly honestly no

 Catholics will ever leave the church if

 they have a community why do Catholics

 leave the church because they are alone

 alone in your faith that's why those of

 you who do not belong to any faith

 community your faith is at risk we are not always strong even the bishop

 is not strong I know your support you

 cannot stand alone you cannot journey

 alone we need each other

 so you know my dear brothers and sisters

 let me conclude this only I want to say

 this to you you know I'm already 16 on

 this year I've just finished 4 years in

 office honestly I do not know how many

 more years although strictly speaking

 the bishop retires as 75 so technically

 I got 15 more years but I don't think

 that long

 I'm meeting in terms of 10 years after

 that I'm not too sure what will happen

 to me I don't say to myself of plenty of

 time I gave myself ten years and then we

 will see how so if you believed in my

 vision for the diocese for our country

 the build of vibrant missionary

 evangelistic community

 then join me work with me

 collaborate with me be good stewards if

 you have talents share with us your

 talents if you have time share your time

 with us if you have resources share your

 resources because because they meet

 early exhibition everything I have to

 where the money time resources whatever

 I have I use it for the service of the

 church so I appeal to you let us look

 together my time your time is short as

 I've said I have no ambition as a bishop

 I only got a vision I got the dream and

 asked you to help me to realize this

 dream this dreamed is for everyone not

 even for catholics only what hold of

 Singapore this dream is what the Lord

 has given to me I'm sharing with you I'm

 not bothered whether honestly but they

 even this dream can be realized or not

 because impulses in the second-leading

 conscience is clear and my conscience is

 clear I'm not worried about how people

 would judge me as a bishop simple says

 leave it to the end of time but I'm

 concerned about how God will judge me

 any non honesty I feel I have done all I

 could s official to get the church

 together to get religious leaders

 together to work is want to build a

 string and your brothers and sisters you

 have to answer for yourself before God

 simple tells us that time will come when

 God will reveal your secret intentions

 and you will have to answer before God

 what the Lord has blessed you lived

 it is not for me to judge you my dear

 brothers and sisters share this dream

 with me and this can be a beautiful

 church for you or your children in
