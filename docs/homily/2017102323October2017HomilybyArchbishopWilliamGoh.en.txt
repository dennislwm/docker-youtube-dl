 my dear brothers and sisters in Christ

 it is in our DNA that every person wants

 to fight for his rights and so when our

 rights are violated we want our rights

 to be restored it is not wrong my gay

 brothers and sisters the demand arised

 but it is not the way of the gospel

 unfortunately the truth is inhabitance

 is a gift no one is entitled to the

 inheritance of someone else strictly

 speaking it's not to say that this man

 who asked Jesus was asking something

 that was basic to him he had more than

 enough and this is because of greed what

 is the cause of freedom the cause of

 greed is the lack of trust in divine

 providence we are afraid that we will

 not have enough when we don't trust God

 when we did only trust ourselves this is

 the reason or Creed what is justice

 justice is not having more or having

 less just this is to have a right

 relationship with God with our neighbors

 but above the daughters given to us is

 for us to grow in holiness to grow in

 love to grow in service to become more

 Jesus and it is in giving insuring that

 would become happier and more joyful in

 life and so it is with these words in

 mind that we learn to give our life to

 Jesus and let all that this news of me

 have for the good of humanity
