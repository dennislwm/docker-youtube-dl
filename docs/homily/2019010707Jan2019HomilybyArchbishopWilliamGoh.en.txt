Why do we have sacramentals? Why do we have Sacraments? The basis for sacramentals and Sacraments, they're all rooted in the incarnation.The whole purpose, therefore, for us Christians is we must believe in the incarnation. That Jesus was truly a man even though He was truly God. That is the basis for Christian faith.
Love must be something concrete, something that can be experienced. Christian love must be concretised in actions. So, if Jesus became man for us so that we can encounter God through His humanity, through His life, through His teaching, most of all through his Passion,
Death and Resurrection, that is the basis for the Sacraments. So, Jesus is the Sacrament of God. Jesus is the Sacrament of the Father.

Sacraments is a sign, not just a sign but a sign is also a reality. Sacrament is more than just a symbol. It brings about what it signifies. So, the Eucharist that we celebrate is not just only a symbol of Christ. It is truly Christ. And that is the difference.

Sacraments are therefore prolongation of Jesus'
presence. Because when Jesus knew that after His death, how are we going to encounter Jesus?
How are we going to continue to receive His mercy and His love? Through the seven Sacraments.
Charity, service to the poor, these are all part of the extension of the incarnation.
Faith in the incarnation, means to say, the way to experience God and encounter God is through things, through human persons and through what we do and how we respond. Let us give thanks that we will draw out the incarnation,

the principle in our faith.
