Each one of us, we are called to be shepherds to one another, shepherds to those people under our care. All of us are shepherds in some way, so long as we have to lead people under our charge. And it's important that the shepherd must be the one who leads everyone under our care to the fullness of life. A shepherd is the one who is more concerned about the interests of his sheep than about his own convenience, about his own interests.

The most important thing a leader should do is to pray, to meditate on the Scriptures,

to spend time with Jesus, to have intimacy with Him. Only Jesus can show us how to be a good shepherd. Only Jesus can empower us and give us the strength and the wisdom to lead as a good shepherd. God has given people to be under our charge. If we have lost them,

if we make use of them for our own benefits,
if  destroy their lives, we have done a great disservice, not only to those under our care, but also ourselves. I don't see how we can be people who direct the lives of others if the Lord is not directing our own lives. Are we leaders who are willing to lay down our lives for our sheep because the lives of our sheep, the happiness of our sheep is more important than our position and our popularity?
