 what is it that prevents people from

 conversion what is the greatest

 hindrance to conversion what actually

 causes people to continue sinning and

 lacking the impetus to conversion is

 always complacency complacency when you

 enter in the ministry life becomes a

 routine -</c> in day in day out day in day

 out you -</c> the same thing if your

 interior house is not in order then of

 course everything else will not be other

 so if you are not a piece of yourself if

 you don't leave a lot of integrity if

 you are not clear of your wound

 weaknesses you lack self-awareness and

 you are just going on blindly in your

 life then of course you destroy yourself

 as you destroy yourself astragalus

 already invites us to grow in holiness

 holiness is something that again we have

 to look at it what is holiness holiness

 is really the perfection of charity the

 fashion of laughs that is holiness

 how do you know whether you are putting

 holiness when you can leave a piece with

 people when you can eat but when you

 will fit people as they are and this is

 where the perfection of charity includes

 therefore the spirituality of communion

 and this is where again any of the day

 how do you know that you are fully when

 you live in communion with people Jesus

 says you know if you want to ensure that

 your house is strong you need to have a

 strong man who is fully I'm the strong

 man of causes Jesus then we need to

 strengthen our house and this is where

 our lady tells us how do you strengthen

 your house prayer and ends consecrating

 ourselves to the Immaculate Heart so we

 need to pray in my heart and this is

 where and let us are so blessed mother

 every day

 let us consecrate ourselves
