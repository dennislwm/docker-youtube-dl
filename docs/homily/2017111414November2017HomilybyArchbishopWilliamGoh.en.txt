 how could good people suffer for doing

 what is right and what is good it is

 important therefore to put on the mind

 of Jesus when it comes to service when

 you have done all have been told to do

 say we are merely servants we have done

 normal than our duty all of us we are

 servants our vocation is to serve it is

 in servanthood that we discover

 ourselves our identity to be able to

 lift up your vocation as a servant is

 what gives us fulfillment and happiness

 in life we need to make also useful

 because that is how we find life so even

 when we serve and we suffer the Lord is

 inviting us to recognize that that is a

 means of purification of loved because

 until we are able to empty ourselves

 like Jesus then we can truly say we are

 really servants otherwise we can be tend

 to be servants but we are serving

 ourselves under the pretext of serving

 others Jesus was a servant even unto

 death and Jesus lived out the seven-foot

 in love in service and we are called to

 imitate him
