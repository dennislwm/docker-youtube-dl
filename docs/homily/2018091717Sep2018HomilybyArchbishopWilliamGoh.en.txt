My dear brothers and sisters, we who come for the Eucharist, it is important that we come with the right disposition.

The Mass that we celebrate is truly the Real Presence of our Lord and the sacrifice of Christ. And that is why we are asked to fast an hour before the Eucharist to make a distinction between just simply a secular meal, an ordinary meal and a sacred meal. At the very beginning of the Mass, we ask the Lord giveness, conscience of our own sinfulness, of our own unworthiness, so that we can approach the Eucharist of the Lord in a proper disposition of humility. And most of all with the reverence that is accorded to the Lord.

And secondly, it is important that as we celebrate the Eucharist, we always must remember the Eucharist is a meal. A meal celebrates unity and love. And that is why it is important that to share in a meal of the Lord means to say, the more we partake of the Eucharist, the more we become members of the body of Christ, the more we become Christ when we receive the Eucharist. And as Body of Christ therefore it is important that as Christians receiving the same Eucharist,

we must be united in faith, united in love, united in service. You must therefore respect one another, be united together and most of all be caring for one another. And thirdly, the Eucharist is not just only a meal, the Eucharist is also an expression of charity. If we receive the Eucharist and charity is not the fruit of what we have received, then we have never celebrated the Eucharist, because one of the most important fruits of the Eucharist is really to care for the poor, to care for those who are sick and to care for those who are in need. Charity and Eucharist, they cannot be divided. We are called to offer our lives in sacrifice, in love, in union with the Lord, so that the Eucharist that we participate is truly effective in our own lives. Amen.
