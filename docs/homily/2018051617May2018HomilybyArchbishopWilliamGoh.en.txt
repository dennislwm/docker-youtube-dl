 unity is the basis for mission unity is

 the way in which Christ would be

 revealed because when we speak of unity

 we speak of loved and it is this love of

 God in us that will help us to love one

 another and so the world will come to

 know the Father's love and that is why

 in the last prayer of Jesus the priestly

 prayer the last Testament that he

 bequeathed to the church is to pray for

 unity because he knows that human beings

 as such they are very often divided

 because of sin and therefore disunity in

 the church would be the greatest

 obstacle in the proclamation of the good

 news and so in order to be grounded in

 unity then the first thing which must be

 grounded in the Lord and we cannot speak

 of unity unless we are all united in God

 and that is why Jesus said you know with

 me in them and you in me may they be so

 completely won the world realized that

 it was you who sent me

 so the first basis of unity is that we

 must be all of us we must be united with

 the law in heart in mind if we love the

 Lord we will do anything for him we will

 make compromises and we will give up our

 differences and secondly also it's

 important if you want to promote unity

 we need to see the big picture we need

 to see the greater goal ahead of us

 because we tend to be parochial minded

 we tend to think of our own area that we

 are in charge of our own what we call

 responsibility but we have to realize

 that all of us we are working for a

 common goal and the common goal is the

 advancement of gospel it doesn't matter

 whether it is this group that group

 because all of us unless we

 together for each other with each other

 then we can truly promote the gospel and

 so finally you want to promote this

 unity then what must we do as Jesus had

 said we need to pray a prayer is very

 important to help us to be united with

 the Lord and without prayer this is

 where all the division begins unity is

 not something that is achieved easily

 number one number two

 unity is easily also broken you people

 are heard then we need to really extend

 the healing grace of God and to pray for

 healing because otherwise you know and

 that is true of many of us actually what

 a bitter we are working from our anger

 from a resentment let us fight even you

 won't produce fruit say that you won't

 produce fruit

 unless it comes from joy it comes from

 love it comes from what we call a sense

 of freedom if there is no freedom and we

 are just acting out from our wounds you

 will hurt others and it would destroy

 the gospel that we want to proclaim
