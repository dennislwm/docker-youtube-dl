There is always this temptation to individualism in the world today. This tendency to think of ourselves before others, before the larger interests of the community is present everywhere,

sometimes often at expense of the common good of the community.

All of us, we are called to be one. And the basis for Catholicism is not just to call yourself a Catholic, but to be a Catholic means to say that we have equal concern for other Catholics in the world.

That is why whatever is happening in other countries will also have an impact on us, because we are one family, we suffer together and we rejoice together. Christ is the Head of the Church. All of us are baptised in Christ Jesus and therefore we share in Christ's body. We are interdependent and we are dependent on each other. Because all of us, we make up one body therefore the Lord has given us all different gifts. Because we are not complete, we all need each other. And that is why it'o important to recognise our gits, to recognise our place in the building of the body of Christ. Our charisms are different from one another.

There is no need to compete with each other because we are different. We are here to complete and never compete. Each one of us must first and foremost value our charisms, value our talents, our uniqueness, so that we won't be envious of others. Envy is always a result of non appreciation and recognition of one's own gift. We are here precisely to support each other, to complete one another. In life if everybody is responsible for his or her task, there will be unity. And so we pray that we have the compassion of Jesus and most of all to understand why everybody is important in our lives.
