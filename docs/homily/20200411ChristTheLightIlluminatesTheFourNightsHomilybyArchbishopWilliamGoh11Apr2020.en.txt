  on Easter Vigil  and on Easter Sunday and indeed  throughout the entire octave of Easter  all the gospel readings will make  reference to the empty tomb this evening  we had the story of Mary Magdalene and  the other Mary running to the tomb when  they saw the stone was rolled away and  the tomb empty they were amazed Mary of  Magdalene was furious sadness because  she thought someone stole the body of  Jesus away the apostles and disciples  who heard about the daft and then his  resurrection were also filled with  amazement in today's Gospel we are told  that Peter himself he went to the tomb  but he did not come to any conclusions  my dear brothers and sisters the empty  tomb showed that the disciples and  apostles were mystified what happened to  the body was it stolen  who wrote a stone the way there were  many questions that they could not  answer my dear brothers and sisters we  too are in this empty tomb during this  Kovach 19 pandemic we are in this tomb that experience emptiness  everything appears to be an he  streets are empty the roads are empty  the offices are empty and even the  nightclubs in the discos are empty  praise be to God and to the casino are  empty greater praise and thanks to God  and our pockets are also empty thanks to  the government they will fill your  pockets  so you know my dear brothers and sisters  in this empty tomb we have many  questions to ask as well what did this  pandemic happened why did God allow it  to happen why is it that so many people  are suffering innocently many died my  dear brothers and sisters again these  are questions we cannot answer now so  what do we do should we behave like Mary  of Magdalene who was crying outside the  tomb of Jesus lamenting who has taken  away the body of my lord or should we  behave that the disciples at Amiens how  could such a good man die he did great  works we thought he would be the savior how could that happen  my dear brothers and sisters this is one attitude we can take  of despair of disappointment resentment  why does God allowed this pandemic to  happen not only the economy is wrecked  our jobs are insecure we are locking at  home we miss our friends and most of all  we missed receiving the Eucharist not  only the mass is not celebrated even the  churches are closed man dear brothers  and sisters if you are feeling that way  this is not the spirit of the risen  Christ because today in the exit that  beautifully recorded for you the church  says exalt let them exalt the horse of  heaven exalt let angels minister of god  exalt be glared at earth be glad as  glory flutter ablaze with light from  the eternal king that all corners of the  earth be glad knowing an end to gloom  and darkness rejoice let Mother Church  also rejoice array with a lightening of  his glory yes my dear brothers and  sisters the church in vices to rejoice  even during this time Boko v19 pandemic  but you might say how can I rejoice  how should I rejoice when I'm still in  the tomb my dear brothers and sisters we  can rejoice because Christ is our light  at the very beginning of this service  the whole church was in darkness and  there was this strong bright light the  Paschal candle the light of Christ  signing in darkness and this light of  Christ will flood the whole of humanity  as it is now in this church radiant with  his light yes my dear brothers and  sisters the Lord Jesus reason he is  going to enlighten us so appropriately  in the first reading from the book of  Genesis God said let there be light and  there was light and so my dear brothers  and sisters Jesus is that radiant light  that Morningstar is the exit that says  that never said Jesus is the one who  will accompany us in this Cove in 1910  Demick he will console us of his  presence as he did with Mary Magdalene  he will walk with us and he as he walked  with the disciples of Amir's he will  free  fearful hearts as he free the hearts of  the disciples the apostles who were  locked in the upper room this  light cannot be hindered this is the light that would transform chaos the cosmos  yes my dear brothers and sisters this is  what the Lord is telling us do not be  afraid as he told the disciples do not  be afraid  but how is Jesus the light in darkness  again so beautifully they exerted  if you have paid attention to the exert  at Christ the light of the world he has  come to bring light to darkness there  are four nights that Christ will bring  the light  the first night we are told is the night  of slavery this is the night when once  you let our forbears israel children  from slavery in Egypt meet them past dry  Shore through the Red Sea we listen to  that reading from Exodus how Moses  liberated the people from slavery Jesus  who is the new Moses he will lead us out  of slavery but my dear brothers and  sisters most of us thing that physical  slavery  visca bondage it's the worst kind of  slavery this is not true at all have you  visited the cloistered monastery our  Carmelite Sisters it phuket kampung baru  they are very happy inside the  cloistered monastery they don't look  miserable in fact I feel they are the  freest people on this earth physical  bondage cannot imprison a person it is  the heart that is in prison  it is the heart that is not free the  real freedom is interior freedom and  Christ has come to set us free from all  our bondages to all our sins or pry anger envy last flattening greed  yes my dear brothers and sisters it is  when we are enslaved to the sins of this  world that is what make us miserable not  because of the physical environment that  is why martyrs and people of conscience  of faith they can be imprisoned but you  cannot imprison your spirit the spirit  is free with no conscience is free and  that's why the Lord wants to set this  free today that is the first night  deliverance from bondage --is the second  night is deliverance from the darkness  of sin this is the night that with a  pillar of fire banish the darkness of  sin my dear brothers and sisters we  speak of the darkness of sin the  deceitfulness of sin why darkness of sin  because we commit sins in the dark we  know is shameful we know it is wrong  that's why we do not commit sins  publicly always in the dark we don't  want people to know that is why you  notice my dear brothers and sisters what  is the world trying to do now the way is  trying to normalize evil we must be  careful they want to say abortion u10  easier killing they are permissible  adultery infidelity it is so common it  is permissible they will want to say  that they are okay they want us to  believe that they are normal they are  okay there is nothing evil in what they  are doing nothing sinful about it   that is why scene  is deceitful  gives us the illusion that what we are  doing is good the will offer us power  glory and all these things offers  pleasure sacks and we think that if we  satisfy our last we will be happy   at all  in fact my dear brothers and sisters  when we commit sin deep in our hearts  there is no peace our conscience were  continuing to pricked us we can try to  silence our conscience but there is no  peace because we are rotting in our  hearts don't listen to the world the  seed fulness of sin and the third night  we are told that Jesus come to live  deliver us is delivering us to be his  children this is the night that even now  throughout the world said Christian  believers apart from wool devices from  the gloom of sin leading them to Grace  and joining them to his holy ones by our  own strength we can not by our own  strength we cannot overcome sin we are  weak we are wounded but with Christ and  that is why we baptism when we receive  the Holy Spirit we become a new man that  is what's impulses so now your life is  life with God you must consider yourself  to be dead to sin a life of God in  Christ Jesus we are now children of God  when we are baptized we are gossler and  remember this don't forget don't behave  as if your churn of Satan we have got  stir and be proud behave as if you're a child of God  claiming your dignity my dear brothers and sisters  don't be fooled by the evil wand and a  final night that we are the Lord has  come to set us free there is a most  glorious night the Lord said this is the  night when Christ broke the prison bars  of death and rose victorious from the  underworld this is the night when Jesus  conquered  as we have seen  the world is most frightened of death  and simple says the fs no more power  over him my dear brothers and sisters  when Christ rose from the date no  doors can prevent him from entering new doors  when Christ rose from the dead he has  conquered death forever so he even  though if we suffer and you happen to  suffer from pandemic and we have to die  we know re rise again Christian  hope is certain a Christian hope is also  certain that we will win victory not  just over there but over sin that is why  the new life to be victorious in Christ  means to say we do not allow this kovat  19 pandemic to prevent us from coming  out of the grave  no with faith in Jesus we know we can  overcome this kovin 19 we can transform  what is apparently negative evil do  something positive and that is what we  have been doing actually we should thank  God for this covet 19 because God has  used these illness this disease with  transformers transform the church now we  are much closer together in spirit  now we find new ways to evangelize to  listen to the Lord now that you are  staying at home you are locked in you  can no longer see you have no time for  your family no time for your children no  time for prayers no time for family  meals now you all can do the house  chores together like a family this is  the thing you strengthen your family  life while you work and look after your  children this is such a beautiful trying  for us actually the strengthen family  born and now no more excuse Oh father  I'm so busy I got no time to attend  conference no time to attend sameness  now spiritual thoughts formation they  are given to you online you can access  them and you can pray with your friends  also over the internet so my dear  brothers and sisters this is a very  beautiful time for us to rethink to  think out of the box not to continue  stay within our narrow box the little  box that we are in no this is not living  the resurrected life to live the  resurrected life needs we must go forth  that is what the Lord taught the  disciples  go and tell yes my dear  brothers and sisters this is a great  opportunity for us so that is the reason  why my dear brothers and sisters when I  reflected over this hole is the Trillium  many of you have told me and I agree  with you this is the best Easter tree  diem we have celebrated even for myself  as a bishop I am not so much distracted  by so many things this is the tree diem  I could spend my time in prayer in  silence in deep contemplation and many  of you have told me when you  great home even your brothers and  sisters who are not going to church are  praying with you isn'his wonderful so  this is where we have to conclude  because today the exhorted again says  all truly necessary sin of Adam  destroyed completely by the death of  Christ oh happy fought that urn so great  so glorious a redeemer the Santa fiying  power of this night dispels wickedness  washes forts away restores innocence of  the fallen joy to Mona's oh we must say  this covet night in pandemic has brought  us new life has brother's hoped a  strengthened of solidarity with one  another and with the rest of humanity  because we all belong to the one family  and has strengthened our faith so my  dear brothers and sisters to each other  to one and all we say Alleluia the lotus reason Alleluia
