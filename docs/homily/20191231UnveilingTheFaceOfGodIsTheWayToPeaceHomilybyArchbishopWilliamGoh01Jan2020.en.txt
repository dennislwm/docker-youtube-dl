  my dear brothers and sisters in Christ

 on this last day of the year before we

 begin the new year in Jason Augustine we are all looking for peace and that is

 why when we serve the feasts of Mary the

 mother of God today we also celebrate

 the world day for Beast this is

 something that is long most in our

 hearts yet when we look around us there

 is so much division and Wars we see that

 the world is in great turmoil in Hong

 Kong in India so in many places today

 there is no peace and if you look within

 our own lives in our own families there

 is no so much division the day not only

 spouse do not understand each other our

 children do not understand us anymore we

 find difficult to preserve the peace of

 family peace in our offices and so my

 dear brothers and sisters what is the

 way to peace the only way to find peace

 in this life is that first and foremost

 we need to see the face of God if we

 cannot see the face of God then we

 cannot find peace indeed the cause of

 division in the world today is precisely

 because the world wants to remove the

 face of God from humanity

 from this world the world says that

 religion is the cause of division in the

 world this is not quite true all

 authentic religions whether Islam

 Buddhism Christianity and the rest all

 true religion promotes East love for

 Humanity respect botherin steps it could

 be true there are some fanatical

 religious leaders that are intolerant of

 people of other faiths but those of you

 Jerry speaking most religious leaders

 they promote peace and love for all

 irrespective of race language and

 religion and there is the reason why

 religions actually they are very

 important to promote peace in the world

 and so sometimes the state can help

 religions to live in harmony with one

 another so the real cause of division in

 the world today is not so much the

 division caused by religions it is the

 extreme form of secularism that brings

 about division in the world today many

 of us have been conditioned into

 thinking and that is what the world has

 been conditioned into thinking that the

 only way to promote peace in the world

 is secularism when we speak of

 secularism I am speaking of a secularism

 that is hostile towards all religions in

 some countries secularism

 is promoted in such a way that religions

 are marginalized and are not allowed to

 be practice in public space they want

 religion to be something that is very

 privatized my dear brothers and sisters

 what they want to do is to prevent

 humanity from encountering and seeing

 the face of God but you just had to ask

 yourself in the world today those

 countries that are promoting secularism

 and excluding religions from public life

 we just have to ask ourselves have

 secularism really promotes unity in the

 world on the contrary those who advocate

 secularism there is greater disunity in

 the world today simply why because when

 God is out of the picture Men has come

 to replace God without God in the

 picture there is no more moral compost

 what is the foundation of morality

 without religion there is no more

 direction in terms of how we should live

 a righteous life that's the reason why

 because of secularism the consequence is

 relativism since no one claims to know

 God or that God does not exist then

 every human person is now not to clear

 of whether he has the truth or he does

 not have the true that is why in

 relativism there is no truth because no

 one knows the truth

 and because no one knows the truth is

 very difficult for us to say that

 something is right or something is wrong

 and that is the reason why today we

 cannot bring about any unity among

 ourselves because we cannot agree on

 even fundamental issues of what is

 marriage or what is gender or what is

 family of what is the sacredness of life

 don't you realize that because of

 secularism and relativism today the

 world normalizes again through the media

 through entertainment normalizes what is

 abnormal what was considered evil is now

 normalized as something good and

 acceptable because when the media keeps

 on repeating and saying these things

 after some time we think that is normal

 when you repeat it often what is

 abnormal what is evil now becomes

 acceptable even Satanism today is

 promoted so widely in a good number of

 countries in time to come Satanism

 will also be seen as another religion

 that is acceptable by society so in all

 my dear brothers and sisters secularism

 actually devices it doesn't unite us

 because we no longer have common values

 founded on truth but what is worse is

 this because of secularism many of us no

 longer lived our life with meaning and

  purpose because there is no more motivation in

 life why do you want to do good have you

 ever asked yourself is it purely because

 of humanitarian reasons that we do good

 or are we motivated because of something

 beyond just humanism what is it that

 motivate us to sacrifice our life our

 convenience our pleasure of today for

 the rest of humanity precisely when we

 do not have hoped for the future when we

 do not have a hope beyond this life then

 we just live for this life and that is

 what the world is doing that is right

 today the modern generation they don't

 care about tomorrow because there is no

 tomorrow there is only this life so we

 better leave and joy as much as you can

 because there is no tomorrow there is no

 reason for us to sacrifice our life

 everybody therefore must try to grab as

 much as they can and joy as much as they

  can tomorrow's world is none of their

 business because you have only one life

 isn't it true that because we are

 believers because we believe that there

 is a war hereafter because there is life

 after death this is what motivate us to

 live an honest life to live a life of

 sacrifice that even in our sufferings we

 know that sufferings will end in

 happiness otherwise there is no reason

 for us to persevere do you know what

 does the world fear most today they fear

  death there's this importances that is the

 wages of sin they fear death because

 they think that with death everything is

 finished and that is the reason why

 people in the world they want to

 experience everything they want to enjoy

 everything because with death everything

 is over there is no retribution there is

 no punishment there is no reward there

 is no life of the data and so you know

 my dear brothers and sisters the real

 challenge in the world today you know

 many of people today they are concerned

 about climate warming which is important

 but very often as I've said the real

 problem is not environmental ecology it

 is the human ecology the family ecology

 that is lacking it's because the

 relationships among men and women are

 breaking apart it is because the

 individual is wounded he comes from a

 broken family a dysfunctional family a

 family is not holistic when the person

 is wounded

 the person becomes resentful rebellious

 and always skeptical and taking revenge

 on society you look at the social media

 how people respond to failures of their

 fellow man how people respond to things

 that they disagree with they use all

 kinds of nasty and imaginable words

 because a lot of anger are inside deep

 within the human person and so when the

 human ecology is not in order

 why do people there

 Oh care for the world and so you know my

 dear brothers and sisters you notice

 that all the three scripture readings

 partically the first reading how did God

 therefore decides to bring peace to this

 world twice in the first reading this

 was what the Lord said to Moses he said

 you must bless the sons of Israel and

 how do you bless them mean the Lord that

 his face shine on you and be gracious to

  you with the Lord uncover his face to you

 and bring you peace twice God asked

 Moses to bless the people that they will

 see the face of God in all my dear

 brothers and sisters unless we see the

 face of God we do not know who we are

 and we cannot see the face of man that

 is why today when we serve the face of

 Mary the Mother of God what are we

 celebrating it is not just Mary but we

 are celebrating really the feasts of

 marry the man of God is to celebrate

 that Jesus is truly God and truly men

 that is why this piece in honor Mary is

 actually more in honor of our Lord to

 make it clear that the baby Jesus that

 we worship at Christmas he is not just

 am and neither is he just God but truly

 God and truly men and so in Jesus we see

 the face of God the least way in st.</c>


John's Gospel Jesus said he who has seen

 me has seen the father and jesus said no

 one can come to the Father

 except through me I am the way the truth

 and the life so to see Jesus is really

 to see the mercy and the love of God in

 person in seeing the face of God in

 Jesus we begin to know who we are this

 is why Jesus reveals to us not who me

 who God is but because he is truly man

 he refuses our real identity and that is

 what's important into this second

 reading simple is the proof that you are

 sons is that God has sent the spirit of

 his son into our hearts the spirit

 Christ our Father and this Deason makes

 you a son it is in Jesus that we come to

 realize who we really are we are not

 just an animal we are not just a thing

 that exists in time and then disappears

 at the end of our life we are sons and

 daughters of God that is our identity

 that is who we are caught to be anyone

 who wants to lead a meaningful life

 therefore must be true to his identity

 which is that of a share in the divine

 sonship of our Lord and only because of

 this that is wise impulses you are

 normal isolate a slave

 precisely because in the world people

 isolate because of the fear of death

 with Jesus he lived a life of love of

 forgiveness of mercy of generosity there

 is the kind of life that we are called

 to live in living that kind of life

 we come to know who we are and life

 finds its meaning and even at the point

 of death

 a true Christian honestly if you are a

 true Christian you should not fear that

 most of you fear there because you are

 still growing in faith if you are true

 Christian death is not something that is

 the end of life in fact that is really

 the entry into fullness of life and so

 we know my dear brothers and sisters

 today when we said the feasts of Mary

 the Mother of God we are celebrating

 also our identity as the brothers and

 sisters of our Lord when Mary was

 proclaimed the mother of God at the

 Council of Ephesus in 41 and this is how

 this feast is celebrated Mary in the

 council Ephesus that the mother of God

 in Greek means Giotto cost

 it means Christ bearer

 Mary was bearing Jesus carrying Jesus

 not just in a wheel and in the flesh but

 in her heart and so it's very important

 for us today if we want to bring peace

 in the world then we must be conscious

 like that like Mary we are called to be

 Christ's bearers we also caught to be

 the Theotokos so to speak we are caught

 to be the bearer of Christ to all that

 we meet each day so on this face of Mary

 the Mother of God what is the greatest

 honor that we can do to honor our

 Blessed Mother that we be Christ bearer

 can we show the face of

 Jesus to our loved ones to our family

 members to be sure the face of Jesus to

 our office calling to be give hoped do

 we give meaning do we inspire people in

 the way we lived and so my dear brothers

 and sisters this is our challenge this

 is the message that the Lord wants each

 one of us to have to be the face of God

 so that when people see the face of God

 then they will find hope and they will

 find a purpose in life
