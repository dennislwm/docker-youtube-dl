  the context of sentence possible reading  this morning comes from John chapter 7  where Jesus earlier on at the temple he  said those who are thirsty  come to me and drink those who believed  in me as the scripture says out of my  heart were flow of living waters and  earlier on in st. John's Gospel chapter  6 we know that Jesus multiplied laws for  5,000 by so doing Jesus was proclaiming  himself to be the life giver the one who  gives water the one who gave bread like  Moses because we know that Moses in the  desert he gave water to the people who  got thirsty and men after the people  were hungry in these two instances Jesus  showed himself to be the new Moses and  it is within this context that questions  were raised about Jesus who is he that  is why among the people they were asking  themselves is he the Prophet that Moses  put about in Deuteronomy chapter 18 15  the Prophet when he comes you must  listen to him he see the Christ and so  these are the questions that people  began to wonder who was Jesus and indeed  we know that truth of the Ministry of  Jesus these questions has been raised  all the time remember the incident when  Jesus come to storm and the disciples  said who can this man be then when Jesus  spoke at a discourse on the Eucharist  many were leaving him and Jesus asked  Peter do you want to lead me to and  Saint Peter said  to whom can we go you have the words of  eternal life and remember when Jesus was  moving to his Jerusalem as his ear a  Philly pine he asked the disciples who  do you think I am and he gave all kinds  of answers and Jesus said to them what  about you this is a very important  question therefore that we need to  address on this Saturday of the fourth  week of Lent we have come to the end of  this fourth week of Lent and I told you  the fourth week of Lent focus on Jesus  in fact from fourth to fifth and unto  the Paschal mystery the important  question now the church wants us to  address is who is Jesus to you it's a  very important question especially for  those of us who are preparing for a  sacrament baptism it's an urgent  question who really is Jesus and the  truth is there is so much confusion  about Jesus again because of distorted  news big news half-truths and that was  the case in today's Gospel some thought  that Jesus was born in Galilee when he  should be born in Bethlehem the Messiah  came from Bethlehem but they did not  know and this is often the case very  often people are not too clear about  the scriptures but the doctrines of the  church they have little bits of certain  doctrines a partial understanding and  this grace or the problem Mosu in the  world today if the world is confused  about Jesus at least we can understand  but even our own Catholics are confused  about Jesus even one Catholics do not  know about Jesus and I think sometimes  the course of misunderstanding  especially of those people who do know  the Catholic faith is because of one  Catholic  because they are teaching giving false  information miss infected in the faith  to others and we get these people more  confused than ever and so we wonder why  that's what is very critical today  ignorance is not excused today for our  Catholics to be ignorant about Jesus to  beginner and about doctrines to be  ignorant about the church there is no  excuse at all in those days when people  were illiterate when people have no  access to information yes it is possible  but today all of us we are literate to  some extent we can hear we can read we  can go to this internet so much  information we have no excuse to say oh  we don't have time to go for salmon now  we don't have time to go for the tree we  don't have time to obtain a course no  excuse it's the question of  are we sincere in wanting to know Jesus are we  sincere in searching for you that is  the question of course when we go to the  Internet we have to make sure that we go  to direct source  authentic sources in order to find the  truth about Jesus yesterday when I spoke  about Catholics being on trial if we are  on trial than all the more we must be  clear of why we believe in Jesus we will  not be able to stand up for Jesus if we  are hesitant if we are confused about  him  so in oh my dear brothers and sisters  what is needed the next two weeks before  the celebration of the Paschal mystery  we need to spend time thinking about  Jesus reading about Jesus searching the  scriptures not just intellectually  but coming to know Jesus personally  intellectual knowledge alone does not  really help us to be convicted of who  Jesus is it is our own personal  relationship through praying through  meditation to pray the scriptures to  sharing the word or sometimes true  they'd be like avenge encountering the  kindness of people having our sickness  healed by the Lord or when we reach out  to others there'o many ways we can  encounter Jesus all we need is docility  humility openness so long as we are  proudly arrogant so long as we think we  know everything that we have all the  answers then there is no way for us to  encounter Jesus humility docility and is  interesting at today in a gospel we have  even a polished they went to arrest  Jesus but after having hurt him they  said there has never been anyone who has  spoken like him you receptive even  Nicodemus the rabbi who came by the  night to meet Jesus he was do Sul to  learn from the Lord and so are we though  some are we open are we receptive  instead of rushing the teachings of the  church because we don't agree and we  really spend time to searched to try to  understand the mind of the church that  we have not done we only listen to what  the world is saying about the doctrines  that the church teaches but we have not  consulted what the church is teaching  this is the real problem and so you know  my dear brothers and sisters we must be  careful that we don't behave like the  chief priests and the Pharisees they  were obstinate their minds were closed  they were not interested to change  they already have a fixed answer they  were just out to destroy Jesus it's just  like the Israelites in today's first  reading  Jeremiah 2 was betrayed by his people  they were scheming to destroy him  because he spoke the truth so my dear  brothers and sisters as we approached  one Sunday and a Passion of Christ a  very important question the church will  asses when you stand up for Jesus would  it be like Jeremiah to stand up for  Jesus would it be like they called Amos  to stand up for Jesus if you cannot  stand up for Jesus my dear brothers and  sisters Jesus has died in vain for you  so as Catholics that is truly stand up  for him with confidence knowing as what  Jeremiah says I have committed my cause  to you for a lot of holes you pronounce  as the judge sentence who probe the lines and
