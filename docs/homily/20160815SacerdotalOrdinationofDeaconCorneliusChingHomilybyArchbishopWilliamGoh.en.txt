 and so my dear brother deacon Cornelius

 you have chosen the scripture readings

 today and I will share some parts of

 these readings with you mmm

 very interesting your first reading from

 the book of ecclesiasticus reminding you

 of the audience of the priesthood you

 are being buried realized realistic

 about the Ministry of the priesthood and

 that is good you know my dear brothers

 and sisters ordination for a priest is

 perhaps the most important moment of his

 life for eight years or more they have

 given themselves for the formation the

 priesthood eight years in the seminary

 is tough you know and stuff lived

 although I think is quite joyful but

 depends on the person I was happy in a

 summary I was happy I'm not too sure

 about Cornelius I think he's happy toda

 and it is a long time and when a person

 gets 14 he celebrates two things his

 graduation day and wedding day together

 so it's a double celebration so we can

 see that truly the soccer ordination is

 such a great celebration for the

 candidate and yet it is important to

 realize that the sacrum of the nation

 just like the sacral matrimony married

 couples to after some time the joy of

 the priesthood the joy of married life

 fades over time and then the joy of

 service is no longer there those of you

 our marriage should know better

 before you are married those days of

 romance were the best time after

 marriage you realize that love is more

 than just romance it is commitment

 sacrifices and that is why after

 marriage many married couple begin to

 realize that the commitments requires

 tremendous sacrifices you are not going

 to sacrifice for your spouse your

 children your extended family you have

 to worry about your finance worry about

 your work stress anxiety disagreement

 over values and these are the things

 that often take away the romance and the

 loved in married life after some time of

 because of disagreement with

 understanding warez you find that what

 you intended for your married life did

 not really happen and so many regret and

 my dear brother

 Cornelius that would be true for the

 priesthood as well if we are not careful

 and so what are the odds of the

 priesthood let me share with you the

  ordeals and all the priests here will understand

 what I am

 the first ordeal of the priesthood the

 first of the other priesthood is that

 the people of God have high expectations

 of us priests they can be very demanding

 they want you to be present everywhere

 but they think that you had a gif of

 bilocation you should be there for the

 funeral for the Puritans for the wake

 when they're happy

 or weddings birthdays anniversaries we

 must be there all the time and they want

 you to be at their beck and call so the

 demands they want you to be very holy

 you must prefer it well do everything

 very well if not they were sent letters

 or complaints of the bishop so they have great expectations of us

 priest and truly because of these great

 expectations your life can be really

 challenging very daunting not only we

 have high demands on you at the same

 time they tell you you know you must be

 available everywhere but of course you

 know father you take your ass you know

 you must spend time for prayer but when

 I call you make sure you're present so

 the first thing is high expectations

 secondly they take you for granted

 after some time no other priesthood yes

 it is a service is voluntary but it is

 no more voluntary the moment our danger

 is your duty and most parishioners think

 that priest we are not great but we are

 expected to do our work it is more a

 duty expected if we ask you for service

 you have to be there because your priest

 we do pay you but make sure you are

 there and that is how sometimes please

 can be taken for granted

 and thirdly you be misunderstood by a

 number of people whatever you do you

 will be misunderstood you don't do your

 also wrong you do also wrong

 if you stay in office the whole day say

 father you're so lazy you should be out

 ministering visiting people and if you

 are visiting missing people where you

  father how come in my office you also have

 problems so you will realize that it's

 impossible to please everyone it's

  impossible and the fourth ordeal is this you

 receive all kind of criticisms if they

 are constructive it is good for you but

 some criticisms can be very destructive

 you get nasty emails nasty phone calls

 they call you all kinds of things they

 can slender you to be ready because this

 is part of the priesthood and this is

 where you are not just when you're

 priest you are also a victim you have to

 offer yourself remember that just out

 the Rice's celebrate what you do what

 you celebrate and therefore you start

 just offering the mass you become a

 victim that is why is so important

 because you have chosen the gospel text

 how can we avoid falling into the

 situation become jaded angry resentful

 because when that happens you lose your

 zeal and so like Peter I think first and

 foremost we need to recognize that we

 are human beings this is not a

 canonization ceremony it's an ordination

 place and the people please don't get it

 wrong I am NOT canonizing him today this

 yes being ordained

 and so in the gospel Jesus made it clear

 and Peter made it clear to Jesus I

 cannot love you with unconditional love

 I only can love you with the love that I

 have and Jesus accepted the limited love

 of st.</c> Peter and so too I think they can

 Cornelius and for so2 we are not

 infinite in love yet so we are still

 keeping ourselves in love so know your

 limitations and accept them

 accept that we are sinners accept that

 we are weak at times but we turn to the

 Lord and that is why the first reading

 tells us at the end the day you need to

 trust in the Lord those who trusted the

 Lord the Lord be faithful to you and so

 you should be focused on the Lord not

 even the people of God focus on the Lord

 and you will focus on the people of God

 and so that is why I think for us as

 priests and eating for married couples

 how do you sustain a marriage by falling

 in love over and over again the day when

 you stop falling in love with your

 spouse that is the end of marriage life

 it becomes a burden becomes a chore so -</c>


for us in the priesthood unless the

 priest falls in love over and over again

 he will lose his zeal his passion

 because the ministry will destroy him he

 become resentful becomes abundant that

 is why my advice to you

 Deacon Cornelius every day is like the

 Sammy's in must yen for the Lord

 intimacy the Lord is the most important

 I mentioned the priesthood I to you one

 hour before the Blessed Sacrament every

 day besides your office your Divine

 Office if you do that not to see will

 not make mistakes you will see me but

 you will be able to click on use you can

 retain the joy of the priesthood

 otherwise the joy be taken away from you

 one hour with

 the Lord and I'm sure the Lord will

 strengthen you inspire you so this is my

 final advice for you and before you're

 ordained and we can be joyful we look at

 the bishop I'm silver each wife you know

 and the many priests around here would

 although we have many problems many

 difficulties many challenges we remain

 happy because the Lord fills us with his

 love and joy
