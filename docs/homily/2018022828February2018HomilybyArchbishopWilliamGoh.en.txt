 many people become resentful of God

 especially if they are serving God and

 then tragedy strikes in your life they

 begin to wonder whether God loves them

 God cares for them in most cases

 people's love for God is conditioner and

 it is small love of self then really

 love of God happiness is not about this

 is about others it is in serving that

 actually we find like that is what life

 is all about other sacrifices didn't

 make the pains anxieties they have never

 been easy but yet after doing all these

 things and you look back I don't think

 you really regret after you look back

 you say I'm happy I have many sacrifices

 I have made a difference in life others

 are given what I could and the happiness

 comes I believe because you enjoy the

 capacity to laughed to know that you are

 capable of loving and capable

 self-sacrificing for me itself is the

 greatest joy that you are able to give

 that matched this kind of joy and money

 cannot buy and so today we are invited

 now to really purify the way we serve

 the Lord and of course the most

 difficult part of serving the Lord is

 not just serving the poor giving

 ourselves but to love those who don't

 love you to care for those who are not

 grateful to you to continue to be

 patient with those who are impatient

 with you but you can do ethically ideas

 or to say the truth or the system things

 that people don't like to hear when it's

 for the good they are really genuine

 acts of love we pray that we too will

 experience the love that Jesus had with

 his father
