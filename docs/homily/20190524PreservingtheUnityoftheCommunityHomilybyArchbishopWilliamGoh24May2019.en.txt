 the heart of the church is loved we can

 have many activities many programs we

 contributing many schools and many

 churches but if we don't build

 communities of love then we have failed

 in our mission we are always certain by

 division no matter how united we are

 unity cannot be taken for granted and so

 it is very important that in trying to

 preserve unity we must always keep the

 principles in August in in essentials

 unity in more essentials diversity in

 all things charity so we need to be very

 focused and we fighting on things that

 are essential or non-essential so in

 essentials unity non essentials you have

 to allow creativity differences but

 regardless the most important sinner

 consensus is charity when you love we

 will sacrifice if you can't sacrifice

 peace you don't love is a simple answer

 so when there is charity we overcome

 everything in life when there is charity

 we want to defer to one another when

 there is charity we want to make sure

 the other person's interest comes first

 when there is charity we make sure the

 other person's needs have to think

 before ours and if we have to come

 attitude everything can be solved it's

 not about winning winning is not

 important you can win but the

 relationship is gone

 anyone who wins but loses friendship and

 relationship they all loses charity

 above all else even people have done

 something bad

 and people see a compassion limit we'll

 help you

 you want to kill him you want to destroy

 him or you want to have me our test is

 to help to heal to have the person to

 come to awareness that something is

 wrong not to destroy we pray that we

 will be charitable we'll be open to

 dialogue we are always trying to find

 the best solution and sometimes we need

 to give way
