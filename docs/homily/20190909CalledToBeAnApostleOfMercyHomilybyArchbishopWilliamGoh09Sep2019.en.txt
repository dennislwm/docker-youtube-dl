What this world needs most today is mercy and compassion.

Unfortunately, this world is filled with wounded people, broken people, hurtful people. People are just retaliating against one another. You read the social media, full of angry words. It is not about helping you, it is not about encouraging you, it is not about uplifting you. Everywhere you go, you ask yourself, are you an apostle of mercy in your office, in your family? When people look at you, do they see you as a merciful person? Or as a judgemental person? If you have that kind of mouth, you grieve the Holy Spirit. What we are called to do - reveal the Christ in us. And Christ comes to give us life, to heal lives, to forgive sinners.

It's about saving life, not destroying life.
If you want to be merciful and compassionate, you must get in touch with people's lives, people'truggles, people'infulness. And that keeps me in my place.
Otherwise you lose the human touch.

Otherwise you can no longer feel with people. We need to feel with people, hear their stories, hear their pains, hear their anguish. And you will look at people very differently. You will look at them with the eyes of love and compassion because we are all in that situation. Without contemplating on the Passion of Christ which we celebrate every time in the Eucharist, His sacrifice for us, we will not have the strength to love, to forgive. And always forgive because God has never stopped forgiving us.
