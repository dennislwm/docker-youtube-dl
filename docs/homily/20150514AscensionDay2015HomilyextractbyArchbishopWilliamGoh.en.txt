 that is fine again the gospel tells us

 the disciples going out preached

 everywhere the Lord working with them

 confirming the word by the science that

 accompanied we cannot do it by ourselves

 this is not out this is not over we must

 allow God to work in US and through us

 so don't think that you alone can do the

 work of changing Clippers like the

 question is not trying to change

 people's life I believe is the lowering

 the Lord to change our own lives letting

 the Lord work through us so the the

 greatness of the gospel is not we do

 great things for God I don't believe we

 can do great things for God I don't

 believe but I believe that God can do

 great things for us in this and troopers

 at least why the horses could spread the

 gospel because the law was working with

 them through there in there and how is

 this possible not only he didn't the

 gifts ugly at all precisely he gave them

 the holy spirit that is why Jesus to the

 disciples in the first reading he says

 wait wait because not many days from now

 you will be there you will be baptized

 with the Holy Spirit only then you can

 restore the kingdom of God only then you

 can make the rule of God real in this

 world
