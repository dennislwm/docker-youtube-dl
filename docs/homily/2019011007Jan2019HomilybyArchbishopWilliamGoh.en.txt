How do you know that you love God? How do you know that God loves you? The only way we can really know how much we love God and how much God loves us is when we love our neighbours. That is the sure criterion of the depth of our spiritual lives. On this basis, then we realise how important it is for us to concretise our faith. When you are so filled with His love, then you just wanht to share that love with others. We are to love because God loves us first. If people are not generous, if people are not forgiving,

if people are inward looking and selfish,
it is because they have not encountered the love of God. So you know that you have been loved by God when you find that you are capable of love. If you are not capable of love, it means that your experience of God's love is limited and therefore your response to God's love will also be limited. So, to love a person is not simply just to love the person. To love the person is to love everything else that person loves. When we love someone, we want the person to know that whoever you love,

whoever is your friend is also my friend.
When you love God, you already have His spirit to be able to love. We contemplate on Christ's love, so that we too will share in that love for humanity.
