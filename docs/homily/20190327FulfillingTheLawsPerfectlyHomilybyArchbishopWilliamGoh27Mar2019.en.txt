Most of us do not like laws in our lives.
We want to be free. Most of our Catholics,

they pick and choose the kind of doctrines that they want to subscribe to, the kind of laws that they are happy with and whichever scripture text is in favour of them. They do not believe in the Word of God, they believe in themselves. Laws are meant only for one purpose - it is for love. When laws are not used for the love of God and for the love of our fellowmen, the laws are not complete.
The laws are always in reference to how to teach the people to love God and to love their brothers and sisters. There is only one law at the end of the day. It is the law of love.
Laws, we have to see them from the perspective of love. If we find that some of the laws today are redundant, it is because the context is no longer present. So even when we implement the laws, we must always look at the spirit of the law. Why was the law implemented? What was their culture? What were their difficulties?

What were their challenges? What did the laws seek to do? And this is where every law must reflect the wisdom of God.
