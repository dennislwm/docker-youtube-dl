My dear brothers and sisters in Christ.
The Church does not exist for herself.

The Church exists for the world and for society. That's why the Church is missionary in nature. And for this reason,
our Archdiocesan vision is to build a vibrant,

evangelistic, missionary Church. And even if we love one another like brothers and sisters, we will still have failed if we are not the light of the world. And so the Church is called to be truly a place where everyone is welcome. The Church is meant for the sick, for the poor, for the marginalised, for those who are burdened in life. That's why the Church is called to be a Church of compassion and mercy.

It's a place where people find hope,
find encouragement. The role of the laity is not to be involved in the Church. The arena of the laity's mission is in the world, in the marketplace. You can be very active in the Church, but if you are not a witness of Christ in your office,
wherever you are, you have not lived out your mission. You are involved in Church so that you can be a witness in your offices and in the world, because that is the place where you witness for Christ.

And it's very important because we are called to be transforming agents in society. The Church should not be inward looking. The Church is always outward looking, always finding opportunities to witness to Him. Either we evangelise the world, or the world will secularise us. So if the world is more secularised today, it is because we have failed in our witnessing. If the Church is not a Church for the poor, for the sick, for those who have problems in life,

this is not a Church. Even if our parish is active it is an enclave. We need to reach out. Unless we stay close to the Lord, we do not have the power to evangelise.
