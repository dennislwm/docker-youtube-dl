 in today's scripture readings when we

 said the face of the apostles of course

 we are celebrating a mission of the

 church and so in both readings emphasis

 is on mission so we have Jesus who said

 to his apostles who and proclaimed the

 kingdom of heaven that is close at hand

 here the sick raise the dead and urgency

 of the mission they spell out when the

 Lord told them provide ourselves with

 know go silver no have a sec for the

 journey or speculate or Footwear or

 staff what is significant about the

 mission that Barnabas and to is this you

 know for most of us we are so focused on

 the mission of the church and we are

 very passionate we work hard and we want

 to be successful in our programs in our

 projects and we are very passionate that

 is good that is good not we say it's no

 good but I think the danger is that

 sometimes when people who are involved

 in the missional church can become so results orientated that what matters

 most in the other day is the result and

 in the process of emphasizing the

 productivity of what we do we forget the

 larger mission of the church at the

 entity is have we helped the people that

 are under our church whether we have

 grown in faith whether we have grown in

 charity whether we have become not

 committed Jesus whether our field is the

 life that is the most important because

 at the end the day we want to transform

 life we want to change people so you can

 have India programs you can aplenty

 activities it does not be

 that life had changed so it's very

 important our real mission is

 transformation of life is changing lives

 is healing lives that is what the gospel

 tells us the other sick raise the dead

 cleanse the lepers assault the Devas

 liberating people for loved liberating

 people for service that is how we

 measure the impact of the work that we

 do all the other things that we do they

 are good but we must not put the mission

 before the people that we serve we must

 have put a mission before even our

 collaborators and I think this is a real

 danger for me that sometimes we put the

 mission before the people

 that's why clearly when we read the

 first reading from the actual process of

 Barnabas Adamas was really different he

 was certainly very committed in this

 mission he was very passionate and we

 are told that he was all after the

 mission but he never forgot the people

 so we are told in the first reading that

 Barnabas the world Barnabas leads and

 encouraging and he was an intelligent

 person he was trying to form communities

 and they are told that Barnabas he went

 to Tarsus he brought sober and they were

 instructing a large number of people and

 they were there forming people changing

 lives and we are told that when he was

 at Antioch he saw the grace of God

 working in the community and he urged

 them to remain faithful to the Lord with

 heartfelt devotion he encouraged them

 you look at today's again the first

 reading when Saul was just converted

 he was a persecutor and all the other

 Christians were avoiding him

 this persecutor suddenly became a

 Christian with the real honor and so

 they were all putting him aside without

 Barnabas Saul would have never been a

 great preacher without Barnabas who

 introduced him to the community and the

 ATO Barnabas went and left for tassles

 to look for Saul found him brought him

 to him death there was a kind of man

 Barnabas was he went to look for Saul

 because nobody wanted him and he brought

 him and he nurtured Paul Saul and the

 chat both and what is important is

 although Barnabas was focused on the

 mission he was selfless it was the

 mission that was important is not about

 himself he didn't put himself first the

 sometimes when we are leaders we are

 very egoistic it is about ourselves they

 start about the mission it's not about

 the church is about myself my glory my

 status my power and Barnabas was not

 interested in power

 I want Barnabas and followed until

 chapter 13 it was Barnabas and Colin

 after extra 13 it was fall in van West

 different Barnabas and for Barnabas was

 the leader until accepted 13 Saul became

 the leader

 no more Barnabas Barnabas was willing to

 take second place because Saul was about

 the preacher he was a better but because

 more eloquent perhaps and burnt the soul

 that Paul was really good he was to the

 fray he could have said to himself

 war brings fall in

 would be out of job he will be my

 competitor the Savannah best-known it is

 the mission if there is someone who can

 do a better job than me and there was

 fall let him lift he was not enemies the

 king of generosity that Bundaberg that a

 man who put himself second for the

 greater good of good news

 and there is mine we are told you know

 he was a good man filled with the Holy

 Spirit and the filter there was the kind

 of a puzzle Barnabas was and I think we

 have much to learn from him because of

 the way he accepted people the way he

 encouraged people and the way he had

 others to grow to nurture them and we do

 as leaders as apostles it is important

 therefore that as I've said we need to

 put emphasis on relationships on the

 people that we worked with on the back

 of our message on the people that we try

 to reach out to them because at the end

 of the day is what people is not about

 projects so we will just pray therefore

 that we would be like Barnabas the

 encouraging to one another even

 especially a brother who is not doing us

 a nevermind ok ok I have faith we slowly

 push each other a lot that is what we

 are called we celebrated in
