 so my dear brothers and sisters in

 Christ we are happy to be gathered here

 this afternoon to celebrate 50 years of

 Singapore history 50 years compared the

 world civilization is very short the

 Catholic Church herself is already more

 than two thousand years but for a

 lifetime fifty years indeed is very long

 and so if we are here this afternoon we

 are here to rejoice simply because

 Singapore is really a miraculous nation

 and why do I say this

 because fifty years ago where was

 Singapore in fact many people did not

 expect Singapore to even survive FS as a

 nation we were just like the Israelites

 in the first reading in the desert we

 have nothing new resources the only

 resources we have other people and

 that's the reason why we want to give

 praise and thanks to God although people

 in the world say we are just a tiny red

 dog but I want you to know this tiny red

 dot is of chilli PADI stock so don't

 play player and you know my dear brothers and

 sisters where we are today is truly the

 grace of God of course with our

 cooperation today Singapore is

 recognized worldwide as the nation of

 great standing we have one of the best

 infrastructures in the world where there

 is transport whether it is finance

 hospitals schools you name it we are on

 the level of the first world no Tony the

 country has grown so much over the last

 50 years but the church has grown

 tremendously today we have been

 estimated 360,000 Catholics including

 the migrants and today our Catholics are

 very proactive

 today our Catholics as you can see from

 to this celebration that our lady no longer just sit back and let the

 clergy do the work many of them are

 dying because they are all but you all

 have played your part you recognize that

 all of us are called responsible to make

 the love of Jesus known in the world

 today our Catholics a well form and they

 want to know more and more about God and

 that is why greater need for formation

 our Catholics today have become a more

 mature discerning and informed Catholics

 and so that is why we want to give

 praise and glory to God because until

 the lady takes part in the mission of

 the church then we have not groaned and

 this is our utmost concern that every

 Catholic will take their faith seriously

 and will bring the joy that we have to

 be shared with the whole world but you

 know many brothers and sisters what we

 have arrived today as I said is truly

 the grace of God with our human

 cooperation what are those pillars that have stood

 Singapore well if you were to ask me

 there for them firstly so sacrificed to

 justice and equality three economic

 development fourth moral and spiritual

 development what we are today is the

 result of the selfless sacrifice that

 our leaders have made for a result where

 the political leaders religious of civic

 leaders they put the country before

 themselves they put the nation before

 the ambition and they put the people

 before their own interest and that is

 what the second reading from galician

 tells us the core to Liberty is not to

 self-indulgence the core to liberty is a

 call to responsible loved as the country

 we are democratic we are free or not

 free simply to serve ourselves free to

 love and to serve humanity that is the

 meaning of freedom that is the meaning

 of love and our leaders

 have shown the way without their

 sacrifices today we could not rejoice

 the second pillar for the group of

 Singapore is justice equality no nation

 can be united can grow if there is no

 justice because there there is no

 justice there is no peace there is no

 unity and so we are glad that our

 leaders have established a very strong

 transparent independent judiciary but

 justice is not enough and you can see

 that even today in the courts justice is

 always tempered with mercy and

 compassion and even Singapore that booth

 of meritocracy will have never neglected

 those who are weak those are

 marginalized those who are poor that's

 the gracious part of Singapore and for

 the reason even though there is a

 certain disparity among ourselves we

 still are united as one nation the third

  pillar for growth is economic development this

 one I don't have to elaborate you all do

 you are not the progress of the country

 in terms of economic development just is

 an economic development they are

 primarily the functions of the state not

 of the church but as individual Catholic

 you are call reserved even if you have

 economic development we have justice we

 have so sacrificed even without moral

 and spiritual foundation everything

 would be destroyed and in my dear

 brothers and sisters as the Archbishop

 of Singapore this is what I fear most

 for Singapore in Ystad millennium the

 moral foundation that has been

 established in our country the late mr.</c>


Lee Kuan Yew himself we know a man of

 discipline a man of integrity honesty it

 was the moral foundation that kept him in the government my dear brothers and

 sisters what is important for us to

 recognize is this if we don't continue

 to ensure that our people are morally

 upright as what the letters import

 houses in Galatians

 producing the fruits of the spirit of

 kindness compassion and so on what will

 happen to this nation this is where we

 should be thankful as I've said just now

 although Singapore is a secular country

 a secular government so to speak

 the government is not secularized that

 is to say our government is pro religion

 our government sees religion as partners

 not competitors not enemies they see the

 importance of religion in fostering

 moral and spiritual growth because they

 know without moral foundation the future

 of Singapore will be expected what kind

 of leaders we produce tomorrow will

 determine whether Singapore will last

 for another 50 years

 how do we ensure that our leaders of

 tomorrow I will grounded in integrity

 honesty that our leaders will be

 selfless and put the country and the

 people before themselves and not

 ambition this is where the rule of

 religion is very important this way for

 us as church

 what is our concern it's not yes

 economic development we are concerned

 with integral development integrate

 develop means means economy it also

 means the human formation the moral

 formation the spiritual formation you

 know my dear brothers and sisters new men can be happy alone

 Jezz because he has enough to eat whether you like it or not we are made

 of body and spirit we have a mind that

 seeks for truth

 a heart that seeks for loved no one can

 be satisfied with having a good food

 even a plenty of durians is not enough -</c>


you can't eat on you rain say every day

 and that is the reason why you know my

 dear brothers and sisters in singapore

 we have come to a stage of affluence and

 the government knows we have come to

 that stage where people are not looking

 simply for things Ledger's alone they

 are looking for meaning they're looking

 for purpose because man cannot live

 fully unless he lives with meaning and

 purpose he must know his identity where

 he comes from

 where will he go -</c> after daft his life

 just on earth here in gand if we want to

 build our country on moral values

 because today the trend is towards moral

 relativism everybody is seeking for the

  truth but where is the truth to be found

 that's the point

 how can a country a nation share common

 values if values are not founded on

 truth in morality a more relevant

 relativism truth is subjective values

 are subjective you can build unity if it

 is a question of individual preference

 can truth also be decided by consensus

 by voting alone you know what happened

 in Europe just because this country of

 the blind all are blind and they say

 Bishop your hair is black does it become

 black that's why I copy it truth therefore has to be founded on

 reality and the Christian and the

 Christian answer to this is God only God

 who is absolute truth and love can

 provide an answer it is for this reason

 as Christians we are never afraid of

 truth because Jesus is the way the truth

 and the life and our task is to

 conscient eyes to help our people to be

 enlightening the truth and the truth is

 nothing else but the way of authentic

 loved that is why in today's Gospel we

 are told we have been chosen to be his

 witnesses to bear fruits we are called

 to be the light the salt of the earth

 God has blessed us and we must always

 remember this when God blesses it is

 never for ourselves

 god bless us so that we can bless others

 that's the reason why we are blessed if

 we receive the blessings of God and we

 keep to ourselves we will ultimately

 destroy ourselves

 so if we are grateful to God for the

 blessings we have received we have to

 ask ourselves how it can be blessed

 world and what can we do what is

 important now therefore is for us to

 spread the light and for us as Catholics

 we want to give people and to lead

 people to walk in the way of truth and

 for us robotically importance my dear

 brothers and sisters I want you to pay

 attention to importance not only of

 cultivating virtues in our young people

 not only virtues but we as Catholics we

 need to promote the culture of life from

 the very beginning of his conception and

 he left we need to promote the culture

 of authentic love through the

 strengthening of the marriage

 institution and the family otherwise if

 the family is destroyed the family being

 the bedrock of society then we will

 destroy ourselves so my dear brothers

 and sisters this is the great joy that

 we have that we are celebrating and

 jesus said you will make my joy complete

 and your joy will be complete when we

 share this joy with others
