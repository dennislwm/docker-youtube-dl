The sin of hypocrisy is a sin that will lead to many other sins because it springs basically from the sin of pride.
It is because of hypocrisy that we are not who we are. We want to pretend to be what we are not. We want to be praised, we want to be honored, we want people to think highly of us. When we are hypocritical, we will start living a double life. We are born to be free but the person who is hypocritical cannot be free because he's always afraid of what people say, what people think, what people expect of them. So he has lost his freedom as a child of God. He cannot be himself.
If we do not know who we really are, our true feelings, this is where when temptation comes, we are caught off guard. One day, all the deeds that you do will be exposed. And so they are actually living in fear throughout their whole life. All those things that are hidden in us, we will not be able to find that peace. How do we overcome this lack of authenticity? The lack of authenticity is overcome when we recognise that we are already God's children. So we don't have to prove ourselves, honestly. We don't have to prove that we are good, that we are worthy. We already the children of God.

There is nothing to prove. He has already chosen us before we have done anything.

If we know that we have been chosen then we strive to be who we are.

There is no need to prove to others. In fact, we want to express to others how much we are loved, not trying to prove to people that you need to love me. People can destroy our body but when people take away your soul, you can no longer live. So those who live double lives, they have a body but they have no soul because they are afraid of being who they are.

So let us pray for the gift of authenticity and most of all to know that God is with us. Even in our own sinfulness, the Lord continues to love us. He doesn't stop loving us. And we need to accept that we are loved and so that we will be able to love the way the Lord has loved us.
