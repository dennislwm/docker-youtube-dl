 so today we celebrate the feasts of the

 chair of sin Peter the Apostle of course

 when we speak of the track

 the chair is always a symbol of

 authority it is the symbol of an office

 next sense it is very important that

 when we in leadership

 it's a servant leadership so leadership

 stop service not only to serve that is

 one way of being a servant leadership to

 serve but for me that is not enough we

 must be a leader teaching how others

 should suffer so he's not a servant

 leadership in a sense of me okay I said

 here at the camp that is only one thing

 but to be a servant leader means to say

 we want to teach others how to be

 servants and so as the leader three

 things we are taught to do of the first

 thing we are called to do as a leader is

 really to as well

 gospel says st.</c> Peter is supposed to

 preserve and protect the church by

 eating the church in the way of truth

 and so as leaders we are those of you

 who I the office here but we do we try

 to protect the truth we try to ensure

 that the truth is result that is our

 responsibility as parents as well is the

 same responsibility so the Holy Father

 is given the given in vanity only

 insofar when it comes to faith and

 morals because the church really we are

 called to be the one who preserved the

 truth that has been given to us review

 dress by God in the world

 the second responsibility of a leader is

 not just to preserve the truth it is to

 preserve unity and I think this is where

 a submission I think for me the greatest

 challenge the breeze of the truth is

 important to encourage the Congress who

 say the truth but we always say the

 truth previously spoken but it must've

 spoken always in charity and humility

  truth we cannot be afraid of the truth if you

 have rid of the truth then we have lost

 our moral equality second thing it's not

 only preserved through unity that is

 also a big change and this is a change

 from unity fostering unity is not easy

 so leaders cannot destroy if original

 brings about disunity then you don't

 want leader leader the facility is a man

 who plays the peacemaker mediation

 crisis bring people together and this

 takes a lot of patience because the

 worst thing is as a leader we divide the

  community the duty of a leader as what happened to

 Saint Peter was this prophecy is not

 here the gospel is buttered out after

 declaring Jesus with the price and Jesus

 speaks smoke above his passion say Peter

 says we should not happy you and Jesus

 says get behind me Satan dead after his

 fall it does Jesus say Peter

 he must wait strengthen his friends and

 so as st.</c> Peter Kostis as the shepherd

 but we do we need to support each other

 in power people in ours we need to help

 others to be what we call seven leaders

 so my work is a bishop really the the

 most -</c> most inner part I think is ready

 to speak the truth even though the truth

 sometimes could not be heard properly to

 preserve unity this the one that makes

 my hair gray completely and the last

 part what we call empowering people

 there is a year stop easier to offer mr.</c>


Bishop is our people the last boss I

 said leader to do all these things you

 know please I think Peter tells us you

 know don't forget and that would be

 I tell you myself

 he says I'm a witness to the sufferings

 Express so a little differential in the

 stock way if you don't carry it across

 you can be lethal so some people only

 when the group army the shipper or the

 owner the privileges the suffering so

 that's why you can't get either without

 carrying the cross that is part of life

 you can I expect to be a parent without

 getting across there is no way there is

 no way it's the price of leadership and

 we have to be ready to carry the cross

 and this is where I think it's important

 when skin to form our faith in Christ so

 for me as a leader about you I find

 strength every money as you pray the

 responsiveness up my strength is we just

 have to rely on the strength that comes

 from God we need to rely on this wisdom

 on this -</c> oh you can't beat unless you

 are first met so I want to ask you this

 final equation you are either in August

 who is giving you who is your leader

 are you own leader if you only own

 leader then you will beat them into the

 beat we need a leader witness and the

 leader across excrescences so there is

 no way for me to assume leadership

 unless we turn to the Lord who can

 console us in those moments when we in a

 valley of darkness he can encourage this

 those times and we are lost the same

 when we have heard those that many

 wounded and we think of Jesus as the

 great leader who has needed let us into

 the greener pasture by a me
