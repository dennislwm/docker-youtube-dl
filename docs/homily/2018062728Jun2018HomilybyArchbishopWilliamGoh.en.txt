 and so it's important for us as we again

 reflect on the questions of leadership

 we are never leaders for ourselves all

 of us who are in responsibility we have

 to realize that leadership is not even

 to rest just for our own to fulfill our

 own will to satisfy ourselves but it is

 always for the sake of the greater good

 of the community we are parents in your

 family in the office as well in the

 country in the community and it's

 important therefore for us to realized

 the implications of how we lift up our

 leadership the consequences that others

 will suffer on the counter fist if we do

 not leave a proper light if we do not

 conduct ourselves it's not only we

 suffer the consequences our children's

 children's children they will suffer the

 community will suffer and this is why we

 should be motivated as leaders as

 parents to continue to grow in our faith

 and to be good examples that is fine

 today's gospel Jesus makes it clear what

 is it that you will use in order to be

 good leaders how do you build a house

 that is what the Lord said if your house

 you unroped so that when rain came down

 Plus Rose gives blue you remain strong a

 sensible man is one therefore who would

 be his house on rock he listens to the

 words of Jesus and acts on them so for

 us as leaders the first thing we need to

 do is to listen we need to be praying

 people we need to be reflective people

 we need to be grounded in the Word of

 God and secondly then to act on them

 because Jesus also in the gospel makes

 it clear early on today it is our own in

  purpose relationship with a lot that would give

 us the grace to really lift our

 leadership Jesus can see clear not those

 who say to me both Lord will enter the

 kingdom but those who do the will of my

 father in heaven is this intimacy of the

 boss that is important and this is where

 today we are called to as leaders to

 build our house on the solid rock and to

 increase intensify relationship the Lord

 so that at the end the gospel we are

 told he is teaching me a deep impression

 on the people because he taught them

 with authority and not like their own

 scribes to teach them the authority is

 not just to teach with conviction but to

 live our life in such a way that we

 become models become mentors for those

 people under our care and as I have said

 you know this leadership that is given

 to us at the end of the day is you be

 happy not at the end today when you are

 cool when you look back and say now

 these people they have came from us and

 these people have learned the right

 values of life and they are happy
