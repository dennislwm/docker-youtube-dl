 as we celebrate this dedication of st.</c>


John Lateran Basilica we are reminded of

 our connection with room and support

 with the Holy Father that we are all

 want Holy Roman Catholic Church and this

 is a symbol of our unity we are much

 more concerned than just a building we

 are concerned about the community we are

 all God's temple and that is what makes

 the church a church we have nice

 architecture beautiful memories of the

 past is in order that they will have

 faith will be reawakened that is the

 reason why churches are good reminders

 of the dwelling place of God and

 especially those who have no faith

 hopefully when they enter the church

 they will experience a sense of the

 sacred the presence of God the church is

 to be the radiant sign of God's presence

 the church is got a brick chapter to

 those who are homeless or marginalized

 so the church must be a sign of hope for

 others a refuge for others how do we

 make our church more welcoming today I'm

 in depth important area for reflection

 our church also life-giving that is to

 say when we select mass the Eucharist

 are we really giving life do we have

 people to find life and it is very

 important to reach out to the poor the

 hopeless to give hope to those who are

 suffering this is what makes the church

 really a mother church not just to our

 own people but like giving to those

 people who are outside the church we can

 press and Penkala for all those priests

 who are dedicated who mix the church

 welcoming and who really have a half of

 the people and who takes the initiative

 to continue to give life to teach and to

 guide and this the priest that we want

 to pray for and want to thank God for

 all those priests that have come

 as well and because the church is what

 it is today because of the prison of

 many people many people all offers have

 somehow contribute with the church amen
