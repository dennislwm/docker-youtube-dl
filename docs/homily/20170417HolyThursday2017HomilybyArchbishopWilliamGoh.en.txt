 please be seated my brothers and sisters in Christ Maundy

 Thursday the word originates from the

 Latin word mandate that is to say the

 new commandment in the gospel Jesus to

 the disciples I give you a new

 commandment love one another as I have

 loved you and this new commandment was

 expressed in the washing of the feet of

 his disciples and Jesus commanded the

 disciples to do likewise that is why on

 Maundy Thursday we underscore the

 importance of fraternal charity of loved

 rightly so because the Eucharist that we

 celebrate the mass that the Lord Jesus

 instituted is a sacrament of love and

 unity it is the expression of his entire

 giving of his life for all of us and

 therefore the separate Maundy Thursday means that we invited to do the same but

 my dear brothers and sisters very often

 we reduce this right of the washing of

 feet simply to be a call for service as

 I said it is not wrong but it's a

 limited understanding of this right of

 the washing of it because it distracts

 us from a greater dimension of what we

 are celebrating that is a sacrifice of

 the must

 in truth in the liturgy the right of the

 washing of feet actually could be

 omitted it is optional which means to

 say therefore the right of washing of

 feet is not the main thing in this last

 summer celebration what we are

 celebrating is not some are simply a

 call to service we are celebrating the

 institution of the mass of the Eucharist

 as a sacrifice for the forgiveness of

 sins that is why the three scripture

 readings speaks about this themed of

 forgiveness in the first reading from

 book Exodus it is very clear that it was

 the blood of the Lamb that saved the

 Hebrews from being killed the first bond

 the blood of the Lamb save the lives the

 first bond of the Hebrews in the same

 way to the blood of Christ is poured out

 for our salvation so that we too could

 be saved

 my dear brothers and sisters the

 emphasis therefore is that the sacrifice

 of the mass brings about the forgiveness

 of sins the whole purpose of Jesus

 coming to this earth is to reconcile us

 with God to reconcile us with one

 another and to reconcile us within

 ourselves at the death of Jesus on the

  cross the blood is water for us is what brings

 about this reconciliation you know my dear brothers and sisters if

 you want to fully understand what we are

 celebrating that forgiveness is actually

 the theme of this mass as well is to

 look at the washing of feet from another

 dimension you know my dear brothers and

 sisters serving others hoping others can

 be a challenge for many of us if we are

 not generous enough written a charity

 that is expressed in giving in serving

 could be difficult but it is not the

 most difficult I think all of us can

 give ourselves to some extent to others

 especially to our loved ones but what is

 the most difficult form of charity to

 perform to exercise it is forgiveness we

 can give money we can help people to

 forgive those people who have hurt us

 were betrayed us will abandon us and

 most of the time these are our loved

 ones our own spouse altering and our

 so-called faithful friends when you

 encounter such betrayal in your life

 forgiveness is extremely difficult as I

 said we can do anything but to forgive

 is not a simple

 as you think it is and this the reason

 why many of us we are under the bondage

 of the lack of forgiveness in our lives

 there is so much unhappiness in us there

 is no peace there is no joy there is no

 sense of freedom because deep in our

 heart we know we cannot let go and I can

 tell you many of you holding on to

 issues that we've done many years ago

 and until today you still cannot let go

 you know every time when I meet people they are always telling me all stories and I said this is the thing I miss you

 are telling me I know there are some

 people who come to me for confession

 before they come and know what is their

  sin not to say that I got the gift of

 intuition but I know what are they going

 to say and it is this inability to

 forgive that prevents us from living

 that life of freedom that life was joint

 that's the reason why when you look at

 the right of the motion of it it is

 interesting that Jesus washed the feet

 of his disciples and he told the

 disciples do what I have done to you

 the Jesus really means the washing of

 feet just to exercise this returner

 charity in terms of service as I said is

 included because Jesus he dressed

 himself as a servant

 he been down to wash the feet but he's

 in don't gospel there is an important

 element in st.</c> John's Gospel Jesus is

 presented as the Passover lamb Jesus in

 st. John's Gospel died on the eve of the

 Passover when the lamb was being

 slaughtered in the temple unlike the

 signal --tx jesus died on Passover day

 but actually the historical day is the

 eve of the Passover that when Jesus died

 on the cross that was the time at 3 p.m.</c>


the lambs was being slaughtered for the

 sacrifice but a woman of their sins and

 so when Jesus washed the feet of his

 disciples you must understand is in

 John's Gospel to the st.</c> John does not

 have the commissioning of the disciples

 to go to the world to baptize and

 proclaim the good news but forgiveness

 of sins

 st. John at the washing of feet and the

 giving of the Holy Spirit for the

 forgiveness of sins in other words in

 the mind of things wrong the washing of

 feet is clearly an anticipation of Jesus

 desire to forgive the sins of his

 disciples his disciples had not yet

 betrayed him

 but jesus knew his disciples well he

 knew that they would betray him they

 would abandon him in his time of need

 Jesus knew that the disciples would like

 the courage to stand up for him

 and he washed the feet of his

 cybers to let them know that they are

 forgiven even before they had done

 something wrong the kind of love that

 Jesus has for his disciples and for us

 it's a love and forgiveness that is

 always there always there even before we

 have seen it is good for us to

 technology the Lord has forgiven us this explains why that the death of

 Jesus does not change the mind of God in

 forgiving our sins rather it is God who

 wants to forgive us our sins that Jesus

 would die first in anticipation or else

 you'll be asking the question Jesus like

 2,000 years ago he didn't save me even

 he see the people in those days but that

 is not true even before we were born

 jesus knows that we were sinned and he

 died in view of the fact that we were

 sin and because you will fall into sin

 the Lord Jesus has already assuredness

 that we are forgiven it is very

 interesting for your own reflection you

 know some scholars like to ask is the

 first mass the Last Supper the first

 mass Lord or is it not the first must

 because scholar says how could it be the

 first mass because Jesus had not yet

 died the mass is a celebration of the

 passion the death and resurrection of

 Christ the mass every time when the

 blood and the wine and the bread are

 consecrated becomes a body and

 the price but Jesus has not yet died

 when we had a Lhasa promise

 so what are we celebrating therefore was

 it the body of Jesus was it the blood of

 Jesus the glorified or was it just a

 simple if that were the case then there

 was no first bus

 but the truth is resides thee because

 Jesus is Lord Jesus is God it is

 anticipated in view of the fact that he

 would die first

 is the same as doctrine Adama

 Immaculate Conception in view of the

 fact that Jesus is a savior

 maybe was preempted from original sin

 so in oh my dear brothers and sisters

 why do I say this

 why is this so important it was

 important for Peter to receive the

 forgiveness of the Lord even before he

 betrayed you and the reason is simple as

 the head of the church he must first

 experience that forgiveness because

 g-meter would betray Jesus three times

 Peter would denied you if Peter had not

 received that forgiveness he would have

 fallen into this man when it happened

 that is why Jesus told Peter you are

 cleansed your sins are forgiven and

 later on when

 he did betray Jesus he did not fall into

 despair he was repentant because he

 remembered but the Lord said of him

 before the crows you would have

 been angry three times but the Lord has

 already forgiven with them my dear

 brothers and sisters my point is this if

 you have not received the forgiveness of

  God if you don't believe in the mercy of God

 for you how can you forgive others if

 you find yourselves so difficult to

 forgive others who have sinned against

 you clearly my dear brothers and sisters

 there is no one problem you have not yet

 received Jesus forgiveness which means

 to say you are not conscious of your own

 sins you're not conscious of what you

 have done to our Lord and that is why

 you cannot forgive others a person who

 has received forgiveness will definitely

 forgive you if he had done something

 wrong is somebody forgives you you owe

 somebody hundred thousand dollars and he

 says I forgive you next time when people

 have money when you have money people

 borrow from you one thousand and he

 tells you seem sorry sorry no and crowd

 how can you not alone you have been

 forgiven so much but is one thousand

 dollars you remember that you were also

 in the same situation my dear brothers

 and sisters today when we wash the feet

 of those representing you on the

 motional feet for me is to help you

 recognize that you are forgiven so that

 you too can be the angels of Jesus

 to forgive others so that you can set

 yourself free because as a priest I have

 seen it through in true because I deal

 with so many broken wounded people the

 letters of complaint that I received

 they are not letters of complaint

 those are poison letters really I can

 see the anger the hatred the

 vindictiveness people are deeply wounded

 but at the end of the day for those of

 us who just cannot forgive we destroy

 oneself there is no Easter Easter will

 come and let me tell you he was still in

 a tomb you cannot get out this tool and

 you receive the forgiveness that is why

 Jesus set of Judas all of you are clean

 except one because Judas did not receive

 Jesus witness even though Jesus reach

 out to him knowing that Judas was wind

 betrayed him he still reached out to him

 he never gave up for even include us

 but Judas was not ready my dear brothers

 and sisters would you be a Peter will

 you be a Judas if you are Peter that is

 take recognition of Jesus forgiveness

 and extend the forgiveness to others if

 we are Judas and we will fall into

 despair
