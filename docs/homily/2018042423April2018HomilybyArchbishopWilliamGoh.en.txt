 there are different kinds of leaders in

 society and in the church good leaders

 are those who transform life who give up

 your life for the service of others

 but there are some leaders who are not

 interested to serve the people but to

 serve themselves and that is why is very

 important for us to distinguish who are

 the true leaders that we should follow

 who are the authentic leaders that we

 should listen to a good leader first and

 foremost must be in union with Jesus he

 must know Jesus if a leader does not

 enter this gate that is Jesus himself he

 has no authority to lead because he will

 be using his own wisdom every leader

 ultimately must die to himself to enter

 the gate also means to say that we are

 authorized leaders leaders must be

 appointed must be called by the

 community a leader does not send himself

 a leader is chosen and he is appointed

 he sent a leader is first and foremost

 concerned about his people if you cannot

 lay down your life or your ship you

 should never be a leader the Catholic

 Church also recognized the census vedais

 of the Christian community that as a

 Christian community you also have the

 gift of faith to be able to discern who

 is the true leader who is an authentic

 leaders and so my dear brothers and

 sisters let us pray that we have good

 leaders and those of us who are leaders

 we pray that we'll be authentic leaders

 always remember to lead people to the

 fullness of life
