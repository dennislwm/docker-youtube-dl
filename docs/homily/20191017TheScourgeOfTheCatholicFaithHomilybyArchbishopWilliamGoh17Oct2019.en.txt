Many of our Catholics, unfortunately, they are nominal Catholics. Because for most Catholics, somehow it is always in the mind of our Catholics, that salvation is by good works. Salvation is through the laws. Most Catholics are over-scrupulous about the laws of the Church, the laws in the Bible.
And so at the back of the minds of most Catholics, they think that by fulfilling and observing all the laws, they are guaranteed of entry into Heaven. They think that if they do lots of good works,

then they deserve to go to Heaven. And the motivation is always purely external. It is not interior motivation of love but is basically measured by external things that we perform, whether we go for Mass, whether we are late for Mass and so on. Being self-righteous will prevent us from growing in our faith. So we do the minimum, just to prevent us from going to hell. If we reduce the faith to merely laws alone, then we actually delimit the love of God. It is the law of faith and not what the law tells us to do that makes us saved. If you are not motivated by love, if you don't understand the love and the mercy of God and you don't experience the love and mercy of God in your life,

I don'hink you can ever truly be a Christian. Impossible. Then you will just live by the laws. So if you really encounter God's love and mercy, then you want to share Jesus. If you really encounter God's love and mercy for you,

knowing that you are unworthy, then you want to do for others. Then the reason why you are helping others, the reason why you help the poor, the reason why you serve, the reason why you go to church, it is because it is out of gratitude for His love.

And simply, if we have not encountered God's love and mercy, we cannot lead others to Him.
