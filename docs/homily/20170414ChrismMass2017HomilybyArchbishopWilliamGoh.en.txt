 my dear brothers and sisters in Christ

 it is indeed a great joy this morning to

 see so many forests rivers celebrating

 is Chris must the celebrate Christmas is

 to recognize that priests have been

 anointed to be ministers of God

 ministers of Christ to be anointed means

 that a person is chosen

 chosen not for himself but Orin always

 for a mission for service and indeed for

 his priests I'm sure my brother priests

 were agreed with me that be chosen for

 ordained ministry is really a great gift

 from God not just to the church but even

 to rest as priests because none of us is

 worthy to be his priest

 none of us so to speak qualifies to be

 his priest it is not through our merits

 but really the mercy and the kindness of

 God that he has chosen us inadequate and

 worthy as we are to be for the service

 of the people of God that's the reason

 why when we come together to celebrate

 our priesthood the sentiment is one of

 gratitude of unworthiness money--i brothers and sisters

 all of us are also chosen in different

 waste that is why during these recent

 months we have the blessing of the three

 eyes all at the see our catechumen and

 of course prism which is used for the

 anointing for baptism or confirmation

 ordination of priests and bishops the

 anointing is meant to help each person

 to leave his state of light according to

 how he's been called as a baptized

 Christian you are called to be the

 presence of Jesus in the world as a

 confirmed Kristen you are called to be a

 witnessed a preseason mounted not on the

 forehead but on the hands to signify the

 power invested on them to set the

 Eucharist and the forgive sins in the

 name of the church but the bishop is

 anointed on the head to signify the

 fullness the priesthood and as the head

 of local church my dear brothers and

 sisters the call of priesthood is indeed

 a very noble and yet a task that is

 really daunting because with this great

 privileged there is also a great

 responsibility very often many people

 they want privileges but they are not

 greedy to accept responsibilities that

 comes with the privilege to anything is

 good for us all as we celebrate this

 Christmas to us ourselves

 where there will be faithful to this

 give that the Lord has given to us

 whether you as a Christian as a Catholic

 members of the royal priesthood and we

 as ordained ministers because every gift

 demands a past to do God has chosen us

 always not for ourselves but for service

 and that is why we are told in today's

 Gospel Jesus he read the text the Spirit

 of the Lord has anointed me to bring

 good news to the poor proclaim Liberty

 to captives to the blind new side and

 set the downtrodden free for us who are

 in ordained priesthood we are called

 members of the ministerial risotto

 simply means that we are called to be

 ministers to be servants priests are

 servants of God servants of the church

 even when we have authority Authority is

 never for control authority is never to

 be used for oneself but always for the

 greater good of the community that's the

 only authority that is permitted and

 because of this of this great

 responsibility then for his priests and

 this morning we have to ask ourselves

 why is it that although we receive such

 a great gift yet for many of us we fall

 short and that is the reality of life

 whether is for as priests

 whether it is for you all people in your

 professions teachers lawyers have you asked herself

 the reason why we become priests the

 only reason that we become priests is

 simply because we want to serve the

 people of God in fact there is no other

 reason for a person to become priests if

 he has no intention to empty his life

 for the service the people of God and to

 bring Jesus the good news to all of

 humanity priesthood is not for self this

 wood is not even for holiness because

 holiness is presumed for anyone who

 wants to be a priest because we have

 ministerial members of the ministry

 priesthood therefore it is an act of

 service but again for you all when you

 take our profession have you ever asked

 yourself why do you become a doctor is

 it because of the money is it because of

 status the heart of a doctor is to save

 life isn't it why do you become a

 teacher the heart of the teacher is to

 form to enlighten and yet all of us who

 are in those professions whether a

 teacher were they a priest

 whether you are lawyer we can lose our

 goal or direction the moment we get into

 it we forget our original intention I

 think this is the real problem in life

 before we became priests I can assure

  you all of us were very excited very

 enthusiastic and of course on the day of

 ordination when we've been chosen he was

 grateful when we say

 thank God so happy to be a priest for

 about three months and then we lose our

 Zilla we lose our passion the priest

 becomes a burden becomes a chore but

 isn't it true for you too

 you get married happily happily here got

  married oh I want to love my wife we want to

 love my husband for how long

 don't you also take each other for

 granted what has happened to the

 beautiful goal of having a beautiful

 family for three reasons

 I think the first reason routine routine

 sets in whichever vocation you are in

 including the bridge hood you know I

 want to share this with you because it's

 important what you let me also to

 understand our struggles as priests just

 like any profession routine the moment

 when you start doing things day in day

 out in a prison one year one year is

 easy -</c> yes you can manage life people

 are not asking you for help for one day

 one day a week we can do you have time

 every day every other hour is demanding

 after some time we just get tired not to

 say that we are selfish but when you

 keep on giving and giving

 at some time you feel jaded just by your

 parents this imagine your children every

 day asking for things but sometimes they

 forget it even do you want the idea what

 to do but it's the reality of a priest

 routine when you do the same function

 day in day out when you service you

 crease daily your confession you go for

 funerals after some time they are just

 functions that

 performed the spirit is no more there is

 a duty it's a duty a vocation becomes a

 duty so I have to do it because I'm risk

 but we don't do it your joy because we

 have lost our original intention sing

 for the rest of you those of your

 doctors every time we are very happy

 when that somebody calls you to come in

 help him to see a patient

 you see hello no I need to rest do you

 know I can't be for the patients 24

 hours a day with it second reason why we

 lose our zeal along the way is because

 of what I call administration a priest

 is how to be responsible to be not just

 a minister but he is also got to be a

 shepherd and this is where also the

 danger lies please Accord to administer

 the parish but the danger is when we are

 to involve in administration which is

 part of the pastoral duty of course

 because it's connected we want to ensure

 that church is functioning well the

 structure the infrastructures operations

 everything is transporting but again the

 danger is this when we are too absorbed

 in administration we want to see things

 running perfectly

 sometimes you have no more time for the

 people no more time to hear the people

 it is easy for us to sit in the meetings

 what we say is interesting is boring

 long meetings and getting involved in

 all these administrative duties when we

 rule from our own chair will become more

 and more detached from others and this

 is true

 even in your online this technical

 analysis of problems when your child

 comes to you you try to analyze the

 problem but we don't hear these people

 out and so I think for us this is also a

 danger for us please

 I think their process was smart enough

 in the early church they recognized that

 they could not be distributing food to

 the poor and so involved in all these

 duties they were clear they were called

 to proclaim the Word of God and to pray

 and so they discharge the duties of

 difference for us priest we need to be

 careful today is a bit different

 under ancient days today our people are

 educated today we call for collaborative

 ministry we need to get our lay people

 to be involved in administration of the

 church we are overseas overseas that is

 true but at the end day we need to get

 people to help us otherwise we will lose

 our passion thirdly because of woolly

 temptation you know in a lot of Hebrews

 we are told a priest is chosen from

 among men that is great so that he can

 be compassionate and understanding that

 is even greater so thank God

 presupposing from among men but then

 there is also the downside because you

 are chosen from among men we also broken

 by you all we also wounded today how

 many perfect families have we got

 priests also comes from broken family we

 all have our past we all have our

 history we all have our wounds and

 sometimes some of these wounds this

 history that we have continued to have

 impact in the way we deal with others

 whether you like it or not my dear

 brothers and sisters the truth

 this hour the way we relate with people

 the way we see things in life is

 dependent on our experiences our

 experiences the past shape us in how we

 look at life we look at the list and

 ourselves and so a priest who is broken

 will also suffer the same effect like

 those of you that is why those of you

 are married if there's the same problem

 you never know that your spouse is like

 that until you get married and realize

 that he is what he is today because he

 has a very wounded family background and

 because the priest is very much in the

 world he is attending to you he becomes

 vulnerable a priestesses of Honor we

 human beings my dear brothers sisters

 remember this we are human beings and

 therefore in reaching up to you in being

 with you if we are not careful we can

 also be overwhelmed by you and that is

 why sometimes please fall into very

 temptations simply because they do not

 know how to distance themselves or they

 are not aware of what is happening in

 their own life my dear brothers and

 sisters I mentioned all these things why

 simply for you to help us to be better

 priests because we are not perfect

 because we're human beings is important

 for you to understand us understand also

 our bond abilities so that you can

 support us in a priesthood so that you

 can encouraging so they can affirming it

 is difficult to be a priest honestly to

 be a good place to be saying yes all the

 time to be

 to be forgiving all the time it is you

 demand tremendous grace to be able to do

 that I don't think anyone on earth can

 do that because we are limited and this

 is where the royal priesthood members of

 the people of God you must help us to be

 a good priest they be holy priests to

 prevent such thing from happening

 my dear brother priests this is my own

 you can say secret of how I keep my own

 passion in a priesthood -</c> I'm really 32

 years in a research of course some of

 you are much longer than me and I still

 keep this passion for the priesthood and

 where does this passion come from what

 Pope Francis said is very true

 a priest needs to reach out we cannot be

 stay in office

 we cannot be involved simply

 administration we need to reach how to

 listen to the walls the sorrows with the

 joys of our people unless we can feel

 with them unless we can identify with

 them we will lose our passion for the

 present because there is no more reason

 for us to be a priest because a priest

 basically is one who serves by we often

 just to mention you to you this inside

 that I received when I spoke to elderly

 priest you know one of the concerns for

 me as a bishop is to make sure that our

 elderly priests are well cared for and

 well look after and so we have this

 great idea of building retirement home

 it's really on the way for return for

 retirees in East Coast but I realized

 one thing and this is very important any


- for the carrying value of well

 the parish priest many retired priests

 are not willing to go to retirement home they prefer to stay in the parish and

 they have good reasons even though they

 are sickly even though they cannot do

 much because this is what they tell me

 and I feel sorry and I think it is very

 true I become a priesthood to serve

 don't put me in a retirement home for me

 to rot and wait for my death very strong

 words and I think they have a point if a

 priest is put in the retirement nest and

 that's the trouble with some of our

 nursing home some of nursing home I'm

 chilly meant for people who are waiting

 for death they have no life

 eat sleep wake up the look into the sky

 the four walls

 maybe some visitors might come and

 that's it

 but is therefore how can you live alive

 without giving it is only when we give

 when we serve that we find life that is

 why even elderly priests they might be

 limited in mobility but they still can

 start and the moment when you start

 serving you start reaching out to people

 and we start giving this is where we

 find life and that is reason why to

 further connect and you know not give

 him these responsibilities as they make

 sure when the retirement home is up and

 the retirees are there make sure that

 these priests contactable they are able

 to be integrated in the parish the

 priest must never feel that they are not

  needed they are not

 one touch my dear brothers and sisters

 this is my hope this is my dream that as

 we continue to serve and same for all of

 you remember this if you want to find

 life you need to serve and that is why

 we are called servants of God Minister

 anointed for mission anointed for the

 service of reaching out the poor

 proclaim Liberty to captives and blind

 in sight
