 but this most fulfilling in life is

 relationship the relationship that is

 most fulfilling they satisfied all

 relationships of causes of relationship

 with God and that is what the sacrament

 of baptism this peace we are celebrating

 today is all about we are called to be

 sons and daughters of God to find

 fullness of life to have the deep

 relationship with God it comes about

 through the sacrament of baptism Jesus

 was baptized in the River Jordan not

 because he needs his sins to be forgiven

 the waters of Jordan did not sanctify

 the Lord Jesus on the contrary is the

 Lord who sanctified the waters of Jordan

 to incentivising the River Jordan the

 Lord sent fi all waters so now all

 waters say the use of baptism they too

 will sanctify us both purify us of our

 sins water is also symbol of the holy

 spirit in order to be a true son and

 daughter of God we need to receive the

 spirit of Jesus this is where baptism is

 not just only dine with Jesus but rising

 with Jesus into a new life given by the

 Holy Spirit we know that practisin is

 the gateway to all the other sacraments

 so that is why the reason and a witness

 called blood which is the Eucharist so

 we have the sacraments of initiation of

 Baptism Confirmation and Eucharist these

 mixes complete sons and daughters of God
