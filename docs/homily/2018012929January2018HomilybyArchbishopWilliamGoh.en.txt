 and your brothers and sisters what is

 significant into the scripture readings

 is how David reacted to those who

 betrayed him to those who cursed him and

 misunderstood him King David

 although betrayed by his son and yet

 King David as his soldiers who spare his

 life all King David wanted was for

 absolutely to repent he was not

 interested in revenge instead of trying

 to stay back and reclaim his throne King

 David humbled himself he will true from

 the capital in order to save lives

 he put the interests of his people or

 his own needs

 King David took this moment of disgrace

 as moments by which he can learn to

 purify himself to atone for his sins and

 most of all King David he trusted in the

 mercy of God when we look at the life of

 King David

 we're reminded of the life of Jesus

 Jesus too was betrayed by one of his

 closest disciples Judas we regard to

 Judas Jesus also

 him Jesus who was killed for a crime

 that he did not commit and Jesus prayed

 for his enemies that is the way we must

 respond to those people who have

 misunderstood us and those who have

 wrongly judged us not to take revenge

 not to retaliate but to use these

 moments of being misunderstood of

 growing in humility growing in holiness

 in patience and most of all feeling with

 our enemies trying to understand where

 they are coming from Jesus was patient

 patient with those who rejected him

 patiently those who couldn't understand

 him and we pray my dear brothers and

 sisters that we too would have these

 virtues as King David and Jesus as

 demonstrated
