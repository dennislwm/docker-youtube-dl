  so very good listening to all of you my

 dear young people we are certainly proud

 that you are whippers and with the

 church this evening as we come for this

 conference which is of great importance

 to every one of us because at the end

 the day love matters happiness in life

 is not about how well you do in your

 studies this not what kind of work you

 are doing all these things have their

 place importance at the end of the day

 is do we have meaningful loving healthy

 faithful relationships and so this

 evening the scripture readings are very

 appropriate for us to reflect on the

 challenges that are affecting every one

 of us not just you your parents and even

 as priests and religious at the first

 reading taken from the letter of

 important Corinthians described suitors

 the situation the challenges are facing

 the early charged simple of us to

 resolve the conflicts within the

 community because the leaders themselves

 cannot agree and there were people who

 are lobbying for different leaders and

 dividing the church so right from the

 start the church was already under

 internal threats from without the church

 was squeezing the external threats of

 the world the city of green by the way

 was a seaport and therefore also the

 center the capital and therefore it was

 a flourishing city by Singapore

 at the same time a country like

 Singapore because we are affluent

 because we are a city certainly there

 were challenges when it comes to our

 lifestyle there was prostitution there

 was corruption and people were living a

 worldly life a life of immorality and so

 I know my dear brothers and sisters even

 as I speak of this the truth is that we

 are living in very challenging times in

 fact the world that you listen

 personally I feel is much more difficult

 than the world your parents and myself

 were in in our times society was

 homogeneous which means to say life was

 not so complexity everything was very

 clear the teachings of the church what

 you have to do they were all spelled out

 nobody challenged what the authority had

 fathers certainly no one would ever

 think of challenging a parent today many

 of you young people are challenging or

 even confronting your parents women

 issues in those days during our time we

 then not even say anything even when we

 don't agree with our parents we just

 accept humbly submit in obedience but

 the situation has changed I think that

 is the reality today many of you are

 brought out in the climate where there

 is so much information on the internet

 from you already you are exposed to

 information technology

 and this is where I say your world is

 quite different from others because of

 the amount of information you have

 received it can be rather confusing as I

 said in those days things were black or

 white today with so much opinions with

 so much information i think is to be

 withering for a young person to really

 try to understand what is truth and what

 is falsehood even among yourselves am

 very sure when you discuss more issues

 and particularly the question of sex of

 love or marriage even of your sexual

 identity itself is divisive we cannot

 even do they agree on these fundamental

 issues that is why i say it is a

 difficult world in the world today we

 know that people are redefining what is

 loved what is sex what is marriage what

 is a family and who we are if you think

 that your will is difficult and that you

 are confused and that you find yourself

 unable to make decisions and paralyzed

 by this array of choices I want to share

 with you my dear young people as a

 priest and I'm sure my fellow priests

 could identify with me and your parents

 particularly we are also suffering the

 same challenges and I tell you what is

 my difficulty as a priest as a priest

 being the servant of God and as your

 parents we are all called to uphold the

 truth torturous

 my Jesus Christ in Scripture in

 traditions truth truth it cannot be one

 day it is true tomorrow it is false if

 that is the case then we never know what

 it's truth if that is the case we can

 never therefore leave our life with

 confidence and so this is where the

 dilemma is those of you are parents I'm

 sure you know what I'm talking about on

 one hand we need to uphold values and

 the truth on the other hand there is the

 reality that our young people are

 struggling with the sexual identity with

 the relationships with a friends where

 they are exposed right in the offender

 in a young age already to physical

 relationships the pressure in school

 today peer pressure of having to find a

 partner finding someone arduous be

 putting I mean you could no boyfriend no

 girlfriend even your dead better move

 the kid loves you put thing to think

 then you feel the other place you feel

 therefore you don't belong to the cliq

 all your good friends having a partner

 and you don't have to so maybe something

 is wrong with you and so you know and

 this is where for us on one hand we

 understand your struggles should we

 continue their four to close our eyes to

 the truth and just let society and its

 strength prevail because that is the aim

 thing do we follow what the one is doing

 because everyone is doing it

 there's a problem I think that's the

 question people and there's what do you

 think all the time but further everyone

 is doing it my friends are sleeping

 around pornography everybody is watching

 you turn it on watch is anything wrong

 if people are doing it why couldn't we

 do it so it is therefore true by

 consensus truth by popularity it is not

 truth in terms of objective truth but

 whether everybody else is doing it and

 so for those of us parents or displeased

 if we were to uphold the truth then

 people will say father you're lacking

 compassion you're out of touch with this

 world you don't understand us you are so

 harsh you're so cruel the church doesn't

 love us because the church excluders the

 cause the church condemns us and this is

 where I tell you the dilemma life one

 thing to be faithful to the truth

 because in our my dear young people you

 just have to ask yourself love everybody

 needs who does not need loved even I

 need love we cannot exist without love

 but what the church is seeking is

 authentic loud faithful love but you

 know the world today we're not so much

 interested in promoting love what the

 word interested is promoting sex and

 pleasure testable problem the whole

 problem is that today love is reduce too

 busy girl of love is reduced basically

 sexual love but let me ask you a

 question what is it that necklace makes

 you most happy in life is it physical

 love that's only a small portion of it

 what is it makes you happy when you find

 someone who is loving who is caring who

 is supportive who is there when you need

 him who listens to you who supports you

 it is the area of interpersonal

 relationships it is the area of someone

 who cares for you and is truly

 self-sacrificing putting you before

 himself or herself that is what love is

 and that is what makes love meaningful

 specify 4s brief we can have love

 without sex but to have sex without love

 that is to cheapen yourself and that is

 to reduce the true meaning of love at

 any rate if your love is dependent just

 simply on physical love you know very

 well that relationship cannot last it

 cannot last and so my dear brothers and

 sisters what are we caught to do today

 simple today again in first reading

 reminds us that we are called to be an

 apostle like him and we are called to be

 holy that is to say we are called to be

 sent forth to be a witness of Christ

 authentic love not just love a true love

 nobody wants a fake love do you want

 people to love you with a fake left you

 want pic love no longer so the one on

 Sodor new of course you people if your

 frame would betray you pretend to love

 you but making you

 of you cheating you who would you feel

 hmm yeah actually we want a lot that is

 real that is genuine and so that is why

 today the scripture readings invite us

 that we must therefore be ready to live

 lives of conflict of contradiction to be

 holy means to be set apart to be holy

 means that we are courageous enough to

 be different from the rest of the world

 that we are ready to stand up for what

 we believe we are ready to stand up for

 the values that we hold this is what it

 means to be a crazy and this is what it

 means to be a disciple follower of Jesus

 and we do it not because we want to be

 different but because we want to ensure

 that everyone is truly loved and that

 those kind of falsehood in love will not

 destroy them being courageous to stand

 up for what we believe it is not easy as

 I have said earlier you know I have many

 single women they came to tell me in the

 pasta in the past it was considered a

 value to be chased that's why even the

 church today we honor virgins those who

 live a chaste life but today if you are

 single and someone asked you have you

 slept before with someone and you said

 no it's awkward digging looking but want

 to sleep with you let me so say you must

 be really ugly or terrible can't even

 find someone to sleep around today it is

 no longer considered there for a virtual

 to bj's in fact to be chased is

  considered something that is not right this is the

 attitude of the world and this is where

 we need to stand our ground we need to

 stand our ground besides you today in

 the gospel we have John the Baptist John

 the Baptist was the one who showed us

 pointed to Jesus behold the lamb of God

 do you know the John the Baptist himself

 he was a great preacher he was very

 popular with his people so much so the

 people thought that he was the Messiah

 and they say are you the Messiah and

 what he said he never said I am he never

 said it and if he said I am I can

 guarantee you all the people will follow

 John the Baptist not Jesus John the

 Baptist said the great opportunity to

 make a name for himself but he didn't

 because he was faithful to the truth he

 knew jesus was the messiah as i say he

 must increase I must decrease he did not

 seek for pure larity that's why I want

 to say he did not seek popularity he

 stood up for the truth for him the truth

 must be respected if Jesus was the

 Messiah he just had to step aside how

 many of us prefer popularity we want to

 be accepted by our friends by our peers

 and so many of us when it comes to

 values we succumb to the crowd we have a

 crowd mentality but everybody is doing

 it so I join them if you do that you are

 not a leader you are sheep and also a

 dumb shift do you want any dumb no

 don't be a dumb be a good leader

 show the way like John the Baptist

 behold the lamb of God point to Jesus

 why to Jesus and how can you do this my

 dear brothers and sisters how can you do

 this unless you're well formed in your

 face in your values don't read only what

 the world I think that's the problem

 with you all you only read what the

 world thing if you read what Jesus is

 saying what the church is saying you

 only read what the worldly thing that is

 why your mind is contaminated you have a

 one-sided view of life ask yourself what

 has Jesus got to say we respect to all

 these issues challenging your life as

 Jesus is the way the truth is the light

 asking and that is why a conference like

 this they are meant to enlighten you

 they meant to conscience eyes you they

 are meant to help you to discern where

 the truth lies and not to be deceived by

 the delusions of the world but my dear

 friends in the final analysis let me

 tell you this knowing the teachings of

 the church knowing that teachings of the

 gospel does not mean you will follow

 them knowledge is one thing you want we

 all know what we should do and yet we

 don't remember simple speaks about the

 laws we know that we should not do these

 we shouldn't do that you at least you do

 it huh isn't it yeah or else you just go

 for compassionate precisely we do those

 things that we know we shouldn't do so

 knowing is you not enough you need a

 conviction conviction comes when you

 know Jesus as the Son of God that's why

 John the Baptist because he recognized

  Jesus as the Messiah when the Holy Spirit came

 down upon him he was able to surrender

 my dear brothers and sisters let me tell

 you too for me as a priest there are

 many things in this life that are really

 puzzling there are many issues in this

 life that I have no answer when people

 come to me with their problems LGBT

 there's relationship problems marriage

 problems divorce issues whatever it is

 my heart goes out to them honestly many

 times I don't have a solution and many

 times I also know how much they are

 struggling and they feel so alone and

 miss understood there are many things in

 this life that we don't understand and

 yet what do I do I surrender no I don't

 have to understand all in order to

 surrender the gospel never tells us

 understand and believe the gospel tells

 us believe and you will understand the

 whole gospel invite us to believe so I

 place my faith in Jesus even there are

 many things I don't understand I say

 Jesus you are the way you are the truth

 you are the life I might not understand

 but because you say so I would do it

 because you say so I will follow so I

 invite you my dear brothers and sisters

 be like the Swami's today Here I am Lord

 I come to do your will I follow your

 precepts Oh Lord and so if you find it

 difficult I scored for the grace and

 that is why we must ask the Lord to

 renew the holy spirit in you to renew

 your relationship with Jesus the day

 when you are convicted that Jesus is

 your Lord and your Savior He will give

 you the strength to do what you have to

 do and most of all you must be a forces

 of loved in your school among your

 friends in society in family amen
