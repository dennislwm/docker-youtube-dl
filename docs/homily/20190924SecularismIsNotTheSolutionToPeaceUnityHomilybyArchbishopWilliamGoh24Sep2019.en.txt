The world is frightened of all those people who have religions. And secularism is promoted as if it is the only way to bring about unity among humanity. Secularism is not the way and not the path to bring unity in the world. In secularism, it leads to relativism.
Without God, without absolute, then the people cannot agree on anything. We cannot agree on any common values because we have no point of departure.
So everybody is having his or her opinion today. And also, secularism promotes idolatry in a new way.

Idolatry is the worship of self. People are more concerned about their own enjoyment, their own interests than for the sake of humanity and the future.

Secularism has also resulted in a deep hunger in humanity, whether we like it or not. As St Augustine tells us, our souls are restless until they rest in God. All those people who are rich,
who are successful in life, you come to a stage where you have everything and you are still not happy, because something is lacking. Whether you want to believe it or not, we have a spiritual need. In every man, there is a soul. So when we deprive people of their spiritual needs, they can never find real happiness in life or meaning. So that is the reason why I'm saying secularism is not the way to promote unity in the world.
