What causes us to die in life, not just physically but especially spiritually and emotionally? It is always because of our sins, the sin of pride, for refusing to recognise Jesus, for refusing to listen to Jesus and His teaching. There is this lack of gratitude in our lives.
Gratitude for what we already have,

gratitude for what God has blessed us, much more than actually we need. That is why pride leads to ingratitude. And all these things would lead to other sins.

Then we start being negative towards others. Eventually our hearts become hardened. So, our sins cause us to die. The punishment for sin is to have more sins.

One sin is always leading to another sin. So, how can we get out of it? Jesus said, "The key is to believe in me."
We must contemplate on His Passion and to see the mercy and the love of God intensely. When you know how much God loves you, how much Jesus suffered for you, then you would change out of love, not because you have to. So, during the season of Lent, we are called to contemplate on the Passion, so that we'll come to realise our own sinfulness. And so we know that our sins have hurt Him so much, and that is the motivation to change. So, if you want to enter into fullness of life, then this is what you must do.

We need to contemplate deeper on the crucified Christ, so that we can find peace.
