 so my dear brothers and sisters today we

 celebrate the dedication or the dead

 Cathedral of the Good Shepherd the

 Cathedral of course we know is a seat of

 the Archbishop it is also the mother

 church for the Archdiocese of Singapore

 this is also the oldest church from the

 Cathedral then came all the other

 churches cathedra therefore is a manner

 that gives birth to other churches but

 it is not enough just to know that the

 cathedral is the mother church what is

 more important for us to reflect this

 afternoon is whether the code reader

 lives up to his to her calling to be a

 mother a mother is one who is

  life-giving a mother is one who is fruitful and this

 is what the first reading from prophet

 Ezekiel tells us when the water runs

 through the temple it gives life

 it gives fruit and so it is important

 for us whether when a cathedral or

 Medina parishes is important to ask

 ourselves are we life-giving do we

 produce the fruits of love the fruits of

 Justice of Peace this is what today in

 the gospel Jesus said you know don't

 turn the house of God into a robust and

 it is important that when we celebrate

 these fees of the dedication the

 Cathedral it is important for us to

 remind ourselves that the whole purpose

 of worshiping God of worshipping Christ

 is that we become like givers to others

 and so in many ways this afternoon as we

 celebrate in Thanksgiving for this

  Cathedral we thank all for blessing this Cathedral

 with the priest and the many volunteers

 who have actually helped this Cathedral

 to be truly the Mother Church in our

 diocese of Singapore to be a mother we

 have to be inward looking and also

 outward looking the mission of the

 church is always up intra and art extra

 it is towards the people of God a mother

 first and foremost takes care of her

 children and this is true for the

 Cathedral and that is what Monsignor

 hang and the priest tries to do to look

 after the needs of the people of God and

 that is the reason why we have the

 celebrations of the Eucharist here many

 artists and celebrations also held in

 this Cathedral

 besides that once you know hang also

 ensure that this Cathedral

 remains a house of prayer a house of

 worship you have a 24 hours a duration

 room I don't know how many of you make

 use of witness and it is placed there

 precisely so that at any time of the day

 24 hours the place is available to you

 for worship to come to receive the grace

 from God and besides that here in this

 Cathedral you notice Monsignor hang will

 organize a lot of devotion Sacred Heart

 Divine Mercy you name it he has Sita Our

 Lady of Fatima and so on and this is

 also important

 precisely because to help people to

 encounter to experience the mercy of God

 this Cathedral is always always fully

 alive it's very difficult to get the

 place to book a place in this cut reader

 because it is made use of it almost

 every day

 and so we press and we thank God that

 the church first and foremost look after

  the roof of our own catholics and that is

 why we even get the priests to hear

 compassion a longer hours were

 confession so that you can encounter

 god's mercy on top of that you know once

 you know he's very creative know he will

 have this movie nights and all those

 things all this is part of formation at

 van land meditations he has it all and

 this is where it's important again

 because the church is not just a place

 of worship the church is a place for

 formation but that is still inward

 looking looking after the members of the

 church but the church cannot just be

 focused on herself and that's a good

 reason to the matter reaches out and

 this is because of the outreach the new

 people are doing and helping monsuno

 hang to bring the good news to all those

 who are searching for the shepherd this

 is really a wonderful thing because

 which means to say the cathedral is not

 just attaining to the needs of the

 people this is what i'm afraid

 in some parishes is two pair of you

 minded it is all about the parish

 if the parish is not growing in number

 if the purchases activities just to

 cater to the parishioners we are not

 doing our job because the church must be

 missionary minded and because of that to

 Monsoon a king also have this program

 called landings those who have left the

 church those who are dissolution with

 the church and this program helps people

 to return to the church and last but not

 least is the social program in this

 church in the Monsignor hang is a great

 fundraiser I don't have that skill and

 the social program that he has what we

 call all the Knights and the money that

 is collected really goes to the poor

 because the way

 evangelized is ready to show Jesus as a

 good chef but not just praying and

 worshiping but in action reaching up to

 the poor is so critical to the mission

 of the church and so my dear brothers

 and sisters don't you think the

 cathedral has really been a matter of

 course we still have many a lot of rooms

 to grow to improve but without the

 volunteers without the priests this

 Cathedral cannot exercise her role as

 mother mother and Shepherd and so we are

 very fortunate not only we are the

 Mother Church but we are called the

 cathedral of the Good Shepherd because a

 mother must truly be a shepherd as well

 in imitation of the Heart of Jesus

 so we praise and we thank God for the

 give of this Cathedral for the Gifford

 volunteers the staff and for the priests

 who are working here to nurture your

 spiritual growth and most of all to

 bring more people to encounter Jesus

 amen
