In life, we can be doing good but doing good is not good enough. Even doing good does not necessarily help a person to attain fullness of life. Good works are no guarantee of salvation. And what is the reason? When we do good works, sometimes it is because we want to do them more for ourselves than really what God wants us to do, simply because we are doing what we want to do. There is no commitment. When there is something more interesting,

they would just dump you and they go somewhere else.

So it's about serving themselves. It's not really serving people. It's not really serving God. Of course, there are some who even serve with ulterior motives, for recognition, for power, for positions. A good leader, any person who is sensible,

you must listen. So most of the time we don't listen.

We don't even listen to our own feelings, what is going on when something is said, when there is something that troubles us, when something that we disagree, when something unsettles us, the first thing we do is to react, without thinking true, without praying over it,
without trying to distance ourselves from the issue at hand and to see a bigger picture. Instead they come from their own narrow understanding. And most of the time it's reacting from their wounds, reacting from their fears,
reacting from their pride. We must first listen. Listen, first and foremost, to what is stirring in our hearts. Listen to what others are saying of course is important but it'till not enough to listen to others and listen to ourselves. We must listen to God. What does God have to say about this? You need quiet time to think through issues, your own personal life,  your family life, work issues. Then you can be calm, then you can be always happy. And then after that, of course not just listen,
then we act. Acting must always follow from listening. We need to think of the big picture. And that is where prayer is very important.
