Most people turn to the Lord only to ask for things. God, for most people, is a dispensing machine. Do not work for food that cannot last. Work for food that endures to eternal life. And what is this eternal life that the Lord wants us to have? Eternal life is really living the life of God. So, besides having our own prayers answered for all our physical and material needs, what is even more important for us is to ask, "are we sharing the life of Jesus?" Because there is no other life except to live a life in union with God, a life in love, in service of God and our brothers and sisters. It is only when we give life to others, it is only when we are able to make a difference in the lives of others,

it is only when we are able to give hope to someone who has found life meaningless or on the verge of suicide, someone who is lonely,
someone who is abandoned. And when someone sees in you the presence of God and you give them hope, that is a joy of life.It's important for us to ask ourselves what is driving us to do what we are doing. Is it motivated by the love of Jesus, motivated by God's love for us? So, we are not just doing things.

We are not just claiming merits working for God. Rather, it is to allow God to work in us and through us, to let the life of Jesus be manifested in us, using whatever talents we have, whatever resources we have, availing our resources our talents, our time to the Lord. And God will make use of us powerfully if we are generous with our time, with our resources. If we want to find fullness of life, then simply we just ask the Lord to work in and through us.
