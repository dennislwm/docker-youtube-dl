Mere doctrines cannot change people's lives.
It is your own conviction of how you encountered the Lord in your life. And if you know that Jesus is the Risen Lord, then we cannot deny what we encountered. But what is even more important is not just what we proclaim. What is more important is the life that we live.
The life of the Risen Lord, the life of forgiveness,

the life of humility, the life of goodness.
Because at the end of the day, it is not just the proclamation that Jesus is Lord and Saviour.
What is the use of saying that Jesus is Lord and Saviour when we are not saved?
