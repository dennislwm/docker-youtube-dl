you know every Christmas we celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ and we say that this baby this man is the son of God this is a claim that when people would not be able to accept without Easter there is no Christmas celebration because it depends on whether you have encountered Jesus as the reason Lord it is only because Jesus the man who lived who died and rose again there the church came to conclude that Jesus is God and if Jesus were God he must have been God right from the very beginning even before the beginning of the world and therefore if Jesus were God when he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin he would certainly share in cost divinity it is important for us to understand that when st. John letter was read just now st. John said something which has existed since the beginning that we have heard singer of own eyes that we have patched watch the word who is life this is our subject and so it's important for us that if we want to come to recognize that Jesus is the Son of God which is actually what we are celebrating that Jesus is the greatest gift of God because it's the gift of God Himself turist we don't feel in resurrection if you ask your non-christian friends of course is saying oh it's just a negativity the first way to come to know the resurrection place is of course if we could be like the disciples they say what we have seen we are telling you so that you may be Union because we cannot say we have seen we can say we have heard the only way for us to see Jesus is to hear by hearing he will learn to see him so how then we come to know the resurrection not the historical Jesus we can go through prayer and the Scriptures study and the Scriptures can lead us to a deep encounter with him so that Jesus is made flesh so that is one way for us encounter the Lord Jesus if we do not pray if we do not enter into this mystical contemplation crisis becomes a word an idea a doctrine he is not real we cannot experience him so prayer a intimacy they are absolutely important especially missing on the Scriptures the second way to encounter the risen Lord is not just you need to press the other way is true laughs so st. John and he speaks about love and it is love that happens to encounter the Lord Jesus and that is true there are many lay people they do not know much about scriptures not much about us because when you have love you will die for someone knowledge will make you die for someone but love will make you die for someone then there's a third way to encounter Jesus and this is true witnessing testimonies that is why st. John is giving us witness metimes we listen the best minutes of people of how the encounter God then we know that jesus is alive this rule is you don't need to be a theologian er who testified when we hear people how to encounter God I how God was made real in your life that can inspire people to open their hearts to God and finally the other way of encountering God Jesus st. John says it is union with him Union the funder the only way we can counter Lord Jesus is when in a fellowship with the Christian community because this is where the more is incarnated the Lord is it present though let us pray this morning that will be like st. John who rented the tomb and because he loved he saw st.

Peter went in he looked and he saw nothing he was lost he was confused but st. John he saw and he believed because it loves
