How do we know whether one is a true prophet?
Whether we know a person is a man of God?

A person can be very eloquent. A person can do a lot of theatrics, you know, in order to win people over. All this eloquence at the end of the day must be proven by the life that we live.
Whether a person is from God or not, you look at his life, not his words. We know that someone is a true prophet only when the message is fulfilled. False prophets are those who make all kinds of predictions and nothing comes true. We are called to manifest the love of God in our own life. We are called to be signs of God's presence. And I think if we do that, then people will come to believe in Christ, not by what we say but by what we do. And this is where it is important for all of us again to really repent. And so let us pray for humility,
let us pray that we will turn to the Lord so that we too can truly be the presence of God to others.
