How do we evangelise to those who have lost their faith or those who have no faith? One thing we should never do with our loved ones is try to preach to them. The more you try to talk about Jesus, the more they will resist.
It has to be done in a very subtle, very diplomatic,

very non-coercive manner. And so how do we then help them to come to know and to love God? If you want to evangelise, you first must love God with all your heart and your soul. And second, love your neighbour. The practical level is love, unconditional love.

But you cannot love unconditionally unless you have a life of faith. If you love without faith, that love would become, first and foremost,
conditional and manipulative. If you don't love God first, you would not be able to love your brothers and sisters and your loved ones freely. It's not enough to love. You must be free in love. If you are free in love,

it means we allow the person to choose. And you can be free in love only because you have encountered God's love. And so, at the end of the day, when the person is being loved freely by you, and being freed in love, the person would begin to ask, "How did you love me that way?" And then, when they see that you are living a life of faith, then they know that it is God who gives you that love.
And that is how faith will grow. When it comes to the later part in life, they will begin to wonder and they say, "that strength comes from somewhere". And that is God.
