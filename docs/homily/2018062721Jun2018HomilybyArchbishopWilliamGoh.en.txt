 Elijah was truly one of the greatest

 prophet it was a great prophet simply

 because he was zealous for the house of

 the Lord he wants to bring the people of

 Israel to the purity of faith the Lost

 praise a very beautiful way of

 summarizing the spirituality of a true

 prophet the Lord's Prayer is the motto

 of every Christian we are caught

 required a spirituality of the prophet

 prophet is one who is really intimate

 with the father so the first nine our

 Father in heaven and is this intimacy

 with the father

 it is recognition that all of us are

 brothers and sisters that is the first

 reflection of a true prophet an

 experience of God as father and secondly

 Jesus saved me your name be held holy a

 true prophet is the one who wants to

 glorify God by his life your kingdom

 come your will be done the true prophet

 is always seeking the will of God in

 heaven doing his holy will Elijah was

 simply obedient to the Lord's will a

 true prophet is one who is also living

 divine providence I give us today our

 daily bread

 don't be ambitious you can be happy

 whoever you are you do your best to the

 will of God and that's it forgive us our

 debts as we have forgiven those who are

 deaf no true prophet proclaims a mercy

 and a lot of God do not put us to the

 test save us from the evil one

 a true prophet is one who fights against

 evil against injustice against things

 are wrong when we do all these things

 then of course on life would be happy

 just be contented be where you are what

 you are taught to do the same will be

 done and your kingdom come
