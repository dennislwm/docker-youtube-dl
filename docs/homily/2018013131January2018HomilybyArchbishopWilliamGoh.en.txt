 very often we think that the court of

 holiness is to live a life that is

 sinless but it's a whole life processed

 it's not going to happen overnight so if

 you make a lot of mistakes in your life

 don't be discouraged and that's the

 great thing about King David when he

 made a mistake he was very quick to

 apologize a man who is humble even when

 he committed sin he accepted the

 consequences of his sin he didn't try to

 hide he was not angry to God he assumed

 full responsibility

 he really was sincere and he really

 should repentance if we are humble

 enough if you are sincere we can always

 turn to the Lord because any of the day

 holiness is not your own strength

 holiness is not because you want to be

 holy and you become holy holiness is

 really the grace of God and therefore we

 need to turn to the Lord to experience

 forgiveness falling into sin help us to

 recognize our own sinfulness so that we

 become less judgmental so there will be

 more forgiving especially those who have

 cutters those of disappointed and this

 is where we are called to pray for each

 other at the same time we are asked to

 ask a lot of giveness so that when the

 Lord heals us of our own brokenness of

 our own sinfulness we too can pass that

 healing grace to others
