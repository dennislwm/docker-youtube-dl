 so the leader scripture readings invites

 us to reflect on how we exercise

 leadership there are different kinds of

 leadership that is the first kind of

 leader he is a good pastor you know he

 is always available to everyone who

 needs a listening year but he is not a

 leader because he has no plan he has no

 strategies he's just waiting for things

 to happen and he will react accordingly

 there is a second kind of leadership and

 this leadership is like a maintenance

 officer I know

 so there are some leaders who are simply

 maintenance officer you know when they

 do not take risk they don't want to do

 anything that will upset everybody they

 just maintain whatever he has taken over

 is just make sure that things are just

 continuing but eventually it you know

 the office will collapse because there

 is no creativity there is no planning

 then there's a third kind of leader the

 kind of leader is a strategy Cesar

 strategies and he's the type that will

 plan ahead is very focused very

 ambitious and sometimes also so

 ambitious so focus that is inflexible

 and he just wants to reach his goal and

 if you are not cut out for that you will

 cut you off enough today the gospel

 presenter s scripture reading presents

 for us the God who is also a leader and

 Jesus himself is important for us why it

 is necessary that leaders must have

 strategy must be focused I think there

 is always this temptation to be either

 one or the other to have no focus ought

 to be over focused and notice that in

 the Prophet Jeremiah we have God who is

 focused who is focused on what he wanted

 for his people

 and we are told the Lord said I loved

 you can a blast Inga so I'm constantly

 my affection for you the loved ones to

 be loved Israel all the time and at the

 same time history was not faithful and

 so God autofocus

 he was also flexible in allowing Israel

 to learn from mistakes and to grow and

 the gospel as well we find Jesus know

 very focused in this mission this

 mission was simply to save the Jews his

 mission was not outside Palestine and

 there was this kid night woman who came

 to us him to heal a daughter and Jesus

 said my job to heal and again you

 noticed and Jesus was really focused you

 we need to be discerning what other

 requests that actually we should do the

 our priority what you should do first

 and those that we can do we do those

 cannot do if they say sorry you know

 with a good reason we need to know when

 we say yes when we say no so Jesus

 himself he was very focused this is his

 mission but at the same time he was also

 flexible and so these women who needed

 help and Jesus was flexible and you

 notice that the disciples they were

 people who were actually they have no

 vision they had no focus they were

 trying to get rid of the woman I think

 honestly this is please look this woman

 is giving us trouble and so today we

 pray that you know as leaders we can

 learn from Jesus and from God Himself

 that as leaders let us pray that we are

 more focused in what we do but at the

 same time that is always the necessity

 of flexibility and this is where the

 discernment of the Spirit is always

 important so that we can be effective

 leaders because when we are too focused

 that we are not able to respond the new

 situations we heard ourselves and we

 heard others and so this is where we

 pray for the give of prudence and

 give of distant amen
