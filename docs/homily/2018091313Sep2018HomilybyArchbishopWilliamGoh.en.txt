In every country, in every organisation, we need to have laws. Laws are meant to protect the unity of the organisation, promote unity among people. So laws are necessary in every organisation, in every human institution.
At the same time, there is always the danger that the laws also bring disunity. This is the irony. There are many ways to interpret the laws. You cane have a very narrow interpretation of the law. You can have a wide interpretation.

You can have a literal interpretation. You can interpret the laws in the spirit, or do you want to be concerned with the letter of the law. Just because you have your right doesn't mean to say you must exercise your right. At the end of the day, the underlying principle is charity. Be compassionate. So if it is for the good of everyone, yes, we can do it. But if it is not for the good of people then we should not. So it is a question of prudence at the end. In some cases, it is a question of should we do it out of a greater charity. We are asked to exercise compassion, exercise charity and exercise prudence in the way we apply the laws.
