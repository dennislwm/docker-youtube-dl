Today the Scripture readings invites us to reflect on how to be a leader, what kind of leaders do we want to be. A leader must have self-awareness.

We cannot lead unless we are aware of ourselves, aware of our strength, aware of our weaknesses, aware of our identity.
The second important element of leadership is not self-awareness only. It is a question of having the right motive. We need to know our motives, the purpose of what we are doing. A leader must walk with his people.
Unless we are in touch with peoples' lives, we can't do any proclamation. A shepherd does not simply show the way. He walks the way,

he leads the way. So that is what leadership is about. Walking ahead,

showing the way. And that is what we are called to do. So a leader, first self-awareness, secondly a leader must be clear of his goal, his purpose, his motive.

And the leader walks with the people and finally, he also walks ahead.
