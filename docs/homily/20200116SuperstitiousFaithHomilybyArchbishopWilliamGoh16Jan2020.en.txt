  what is faith

 what is position the wrong kind of

 superstition is to believe in an object

 on something that if we go through these

 riches if we use these objects we will

 be blessed and God will protect us and

 well for flow into our lives

 this is superstition but there is also

 another form of positions even for those

 who claim to have faith because we used

 sacraments sacramentals again just like

 Chinese symbols for Chinese New Year our

 symbols are not just merely symbols the

 sacrament is defined as a symbol that

 brings about the reality that intends to

 mediate so sacrament therefore is an

 external sign of an inward grace that

 you receive so whether you believe in

 the sacraments are not the sacraments

 will work but this is where we fall into

 superstition so many people are going to

 the mass they saying the rosary and we

 say do this we do that you like this

 Canon ain't gotta protect you that is

 also superstition because where is the

 subjective faith so that is why in

 church in theology we always make a

 distinction between X opera apparat oh

 that means from the very book itself

 this objective v then X opera apprentice

 from the point of the believer you need

 to have both objective and subjective

 faith if you were a sacrament if you

 believe in sacramento's then you must

 have a subjective faith to put into

 practice what you believe you must carry

 it out in objective reality and

 subjective faith comes together that is

 powerful because God's grace will work

 because you need to cooperate the grace

 unless you are touched by the Lord

 unless you respond to him a person with

 transformation the grace is not working

 because the heart is not there the my is

 not disposed so today we are called to

 be like Jesus we are told Jesus could no

 longer will openly do any town but will

 stay outside in places where nobody

 lives very significant instead of the

 leper staying outside knew Jesus became

 a leper he was the outsider and nobody

 lived lepers were staying in those

 places where nobody lives interesting

 why it tells us that Jesus carry our

 sins of infirmities in his body and

 that's why he was outside so he is

 identified and because he's identified

 with us and he is identified with God

 that is why the grace of God flows

 through him we too can be powerful

 instruments of the Lord if only we are

 not the grace of God to flow in us and

 then through us but if you don't spend

 time outside in the desert to pray then

 you cannot be a powerful medium and

 channel of God's grace so today we are

 challenged to be like Jesus so that when

 people come to us they too can feel the

 presence of God and they too can find
