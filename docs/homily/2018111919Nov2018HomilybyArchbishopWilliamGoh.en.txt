All of us here, I think, can see. But how many of us have the sight to follow Jesus.

To be healed means to walk with Jesus. And to walk with Jesus precisely is our response to God's wonderful love for us, His unconditional mercy. And that is the basis for service,

for devotion to our Lord and to His Church.
Without this prior experience of God's infinite mercy and love, there is no real service in the Church. We fail to realise it is not what we can do. If God has not blessed us, we can do nothing. So we serve out of gratitude,

not because God is our debtor. When we do not serve the Lord with love, out of love for Him, whatever we do will ultimately, at the end of the day, is for ourselves. If you are doing it out of favour for God, of course there is no joy. But if you do it out of gratitude,

out of the love that God has loved you, it is always with joy. Until the day you know that without Jesus you are nothing, until the day you realise that you are a great sinner and without God's mercy you will not be where you are today, until the day you come to recognise that God is your beneficiary, then you will not be able to serve with love. I serve, simply because God has loved me and you have loved me. My service to you is out gratitude to what the Lord has done for me and what you have done for me as a priest. To be able to serve you is already my great act of thanksgiving to God.
