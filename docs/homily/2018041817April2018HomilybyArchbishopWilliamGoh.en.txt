 what's I can be sure that Jesus is our

 Lord and Savior that we believed in him

 how do we show and prove that really

 Jesus is our Lord the only site that we

 can show to others that Jesus really

 makes a difference in our lives is that

 we become another Christ the Eucharist

 we eat should transform us and what we

 eat we become that is the only proof so

 a transformed life transformed people a

 sign of holiness is when people do

 marriages because we know that is God

 who is in charge not sometimes even when

 we suffer innocently when we suffer

 unjustly in the eyes of the world to

 Thresh death just as when Jesus died it

 was since the tragic death but actually

 in the eyes of God things are changing

 without winnowing so when Jesus died how

 could it be but actually the death of

 Jesus brought transformation so did the

 light of Stephen

 so even -</c> and I can tell you assure you

 those of us who suffer innocently

 unjustly we think that we know we are

 losing a better person we are sowing the

 seeds of faith the seeds of conversion

 only God can change the hearts of August
