 the reason why the world cannot agree on

 these very fundamental questions of life

 who we are what we are taught to do is

 simply because of the very fact that we

 do not know our origin if we do not know

 your origin how can you know your

 destiny we have to make a distinction

 between science and faith Fiat requires

 us to believe that it is God who created

 us and created the world but the Bible

 is not a book of science the Bible is

 the book of fate how the earth came

 about is a scientific questions you can

 believe in evolution you can believe in

 a Big Bang Theory

 it does not contradict pristine field

 because the bible does not deal with

 scientific questions so long as your

 faith in evolution in the Big Bang

 Theory does not contradict the fact that

 God is the source of life what actually

 makes this really human is when we are

 developing our minds and the more we use

 our brains

 the more we are energized so regardless

 of who we are the intellect and the

 world these are the two faculties that

 need to grow to developed we don't

 simply exist we live and to live means

 to be able to develop our potentials to

 the fullest to become the person that

 God has created us to be our vocation is

 to lift up what God has given to each

 one of us each one of us in a very

 unique way if you lift up your vocation

 which is integral development of mind or

 body using whatever we have your life

 would be happy
