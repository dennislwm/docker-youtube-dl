It is important that in life, we must be fruitful in whichever vocation we are in.

A man, a woman who is not fruitful in the way he lives his life, would have lived his life in vain. It's a very important question you need to ask yourself - Have you been fruitful in the way you lived your life? To be fruitful gives us meaning and purpose in life. Whether you are single,

whether you are married with or without children, we are called to be fruitful. We are called to give our lives in service,
in love to others. My life is meaningful,

is enriching because I give my life for the service of the people. If you can pour out your life and your love into the community, you will find your life meaningful. What is most important - our security can only rest in God. Only God can give us that ultimate love,
ultimate satisfaction, ultimate joy.
