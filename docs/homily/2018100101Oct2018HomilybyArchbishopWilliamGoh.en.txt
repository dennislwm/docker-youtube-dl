Today we celebrate the Feast of St. Therese of the Child Jesus. She is truly a great saint and a great patron for all missionary countries. And she became a saint not by doing extraordinary things but doing ordinary things in an extraordinary way. Anyone can become a saint regardless of age, regardless of the work that we do. To become a saint is simply to live out our vocation of love. Whether you are an elderly person, sick staying at home, whether you are a worker,

you are a professional, you are a homemaker, you are a student, a priest, it is immaterial. At the end of the day, every vocation is a vocation to love. Anyone who loves will find his life fulfilling. When you put love in your work in what you do, then everything that you do becomes a joy.
Whatever you do, do you do it out of love?

Do we do it in love, even unpleasant tasks? With love, everything is possible. It is through love and for love that we become holy and we become truly saints of God.
