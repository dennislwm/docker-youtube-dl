  on the first Monday of Lent  the invitation of God was the call to  holiness he said be holy for I am holy  we come to the end of the first week of  Lent  these same core is reiterated Moses said  to the people the Lord your God today  commands you to observe these laws and  customs you must keep them so that he  will set you high above all the nations  he has made you and you'll be a people  consecrated to the Lord as he promised  holiness is to be consecrated to God  holiness is to live alived  separated from the world and that is why  for us who are Christians our lives must  be different from that of the world it  cannot be the same that is what  holiness is all about to live a life of holiness  is to live a life of loved of  selflessness of humble service  holiness as we have seen in the last few  days is the perfection of charity today  the scripture readings deepen our  understanding of charity most of the  time we think charity or the highest  form of charity is to serve the poor to  give to those who are in need  yet the highest form of charity the  perfection of charity perhaps is more  than that it is forgiving and loving our  enemies the word forgiving  simply means that we are for giving so  the greatest gift we can give to anyone  is the gif of forgiveness  especially our enemies but we all know  very well that forgiveness is not  something in graininess the tendency for  us is to retaliate  the nandan see for us is to destroy our  enemies to make sure that our enemies  suffer as much as we have suffered we  want to kill we want to destroy we want  to harm them because of the pain in  our hearts and therefore forgiving our  enemies is something the world finds it  most difficult but if we do not forgive  then Jesus in the gospel tells us we are  not different from others he said even  tax collectors do as much if you save  your greetings we're brothers you are  not doing anything exceptional even the  pagans do as much today not so that's  why the hallmark of a christened the  hallmark of discipleship is not just  doing good other religions  also do good even people without faith also do good  the hallmark of a Christian is that we  love our enemies how do we love our  enemies to love our enemies simply means  that we make a distinction between the  sin and the s are not  people who are really evil more sinners  are misguided they've been contaminated  by the world sinners they are wounded  and they tend to react out of their  wounds how enemies they are hurting and  so that's why they're hurting  so in truth we have to make a  distinction between what is wrong and  what the person is doing most of our  enemies are ignorant that's why when  Jesus was on the cross he said Father  forgive them for they know not what they  are doing and so it is very important  for us to understand this principle  jesus never condemns sinners he only  condemns the sin that is why we are  called to love the sinner and to hate  the sin to love the sinner means that  we desire not our enemies our harm we  desire their enemies are healed  converted restored this is the true  meaning of justice revenge is not  justice revenge is to make things worse  the true justice is when we restore a  person who has done wrong that is what  it means when we say we are seeking for  justice so we can seek for justice  without necessary being vindictive  and that is what all the Apostles and  martyrs of the church they have done  they have followed the way of Jesus in  the early church the Christians never  fought with the authorities many were  persecuted many were martyred but they  stood up for Jesus and they held no  resentment and grudges against them a  very good example is there since even he  was stoned to death and yet he prayed  for his enemies exactly the same way  Jesus prayed for his enemies when he was  on the cross  there was no anger no hatred but only  compassion and forgiveness and so it is  important for us therefore as we want to  grow in holiness we must  motivate ourselves to really love our  enemies but can motivate us to forgive  and to love our enemies we do it first  and foremost for own salvation to love  your enemies is not primarily for the  other person salvation first is ours  because when we love our enemies when  we forgive them we set ourselves free we  have grown in magnanimity  we have grown in generosity and we do  not allow the hurts that others inflict  on us to continue to hurt us even more  that's why those who nursed the hurts  they actually destroying themselves  whereas when we learned to forgive we  learned to set them free we set  ourselves free and most of our hearts  were expand and we become like God in  loved and we are saved in that sense but  of course it's not just simply for  salvation we must be motivated for the  salvation of others because as I have  said sinners our enemies they are hurt  they are confused they ignorant so when  we start loving them they will respond  in love sometimes it takes a long time  which is true because they illegally  hurt but if you love someone enough and  sufficiently even the most hardened of  hearts will respond and that is how the  Lord loves us that is why when since  even died soul was converted so was the  one who witnessed the death was in  Steven and he became an apostle to the  gentle  it was because of the waste and Steven  forgave his enemies that the seat of  faith was sought in soul who later became simple and so   when Jesus was on  the cross when he forgave by looking at  the cross now  we find couraged and that is the reason  why today if you want to have the  capacity to forgive we must always  contemplate on the cross of Jesus  contemplate on his passion his death and  resurrection to draw strength to forgive  those who have hurt us deeply because on  our own in our own capacity we cannot  forgive because to forgive is divine to  err is human we need to draw strength  that is why during the season of Lent we  need to contemplate on his passion and  his love for us so that we can have the  courage and the strength to forgive and  if we do that then today in the gospel  Jesus said then you truly become sons  and daughters of God because Jesus said  in this way you be sons of your father  in heaven for he causes his Sun to rise  on bad men as well as good and his rain  to fall on honest and dishonest men  alike when we love all even our enemies  then become perfect in loved in charity in forgiveness amen
