How close we are to one another, it depends on our shared experiences, on our shared history. So those times when we spend together, those times when we celebrate together, those times even when we go through difficulties and through challenges, all these are very important events that will give us a shared history. Whenever there is a shared history, then we become more united.

That's the reason why if we are not a member of the community,

if you don't belong to the community, if you don't relate it with members of the community, you will be outside of that history. You'll be outside of the experience. Then you become an observer,
you become an outsider.

Who are those people who are really close to you? Those who share your life,

those who understand you, those who comfort you, those who stand by you. And very often, they are your friends.
Our real friendship, our real union is with people who are sharing our mind and sharing our heart. We are bonded together because we have a common history, because we have shared experiences, because we are with the same mind, the same will.
Again it's a very good reminder for us all,

we need to keep on celebrating our tradition. It is important to create that kind of shared experience. It comes about through prayers, through fellowship. And for us,

how do we keep this history alive?
Precisely, the Eucharist. Every Eucharist again is to recall what Christ has done for us. So it's to keep on celebrating. The more you celebrate, the more we are united with Jesus. And that's what the Eucharist is all about - "Do this in memory of me".
To be connected, simply because we are all brothers and sisters.
