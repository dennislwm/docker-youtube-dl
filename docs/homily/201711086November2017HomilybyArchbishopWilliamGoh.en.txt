 is God fair there's a question that

 sometimes we often wonder my dear

 brothers and sisters if were having

 these thoughts it is understandable

 because you don't see the plan of God

 for Humanity we don't see the deeper

 reality of the Justice of God when we

 speak of the Justice of God God is just

 when it comes to two things giving us

 happiness and giving us salvation have

 you got a feeling the joy of giving free

 service unconditional love especially to

 those who are cool tho so marginalize

 those who cannot return you any favor

 they can repay you with gratitude with

 joy in our faces we love in your hearts

 and when you see this joy in their faces

 the smile of happiness

 you experience the joy that money cannot

 find the rich meets the poor to be happy

 if the rich which is sustaining himself

 their life has meaning life is fair

 the rich is the poor the poor needs the

 bridge so we are equal that is why in

 the family of God God wants us all to

  share whatever we have is so that we become

 one big family the weaker people have

 the stronger and both the stronger and

 the weaker people both are happy at the

 end and that is the reason why God is
