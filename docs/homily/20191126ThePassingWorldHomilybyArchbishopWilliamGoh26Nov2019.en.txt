We have only one humanity. That's why the Church is catholic. The Church is universal.

The best way to take care of ourselves is always to take care of others. No matter what we have, no matter how great we are, no matter what position we have in life, we will have to leave them behind. I think this is a very stark reminder for all of us. Don't cling.

Don't cling to your office. Don't cling to your position. Don't cling to your wealth.

Because a time will come when all these things make no sense anymore. So no matter how powerful you are, how great you are, at the end of the day, you just have to let go. So God allows all these things to happen. Wars, revolutions,
in order to help humanity to look at life in a proper perspective. It seems that today evil is more powerful than goodness. And we will think that we have lost the battle. But in truth, God is fair. He will allow all these natural or unnatural developments in the world.
There will be impact. There will be consequences.

It's just like climate warming. You don't want to take care of this earth, then you'll just have to live in a situation where everything will die. And that time, people will start worrying. That time, people will start waking up. So these are the consequences of our sin.

And God allows the consequences of sin, of our foolishness, in order to bring us to repentance.

But while we are still around, we do what we can. We do what we can to arrest the situation.

That is all we can do. We just surrender creation to God.
