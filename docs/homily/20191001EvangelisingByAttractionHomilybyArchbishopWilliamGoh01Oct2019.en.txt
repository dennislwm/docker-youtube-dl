Very often, we think that to be a missionary,
we must do great things. We must go to a foreign land. We must be a martyr. We must be put to death, so that we can truly be considered a great missionary. The best way to evangelise is not so much to do great things. It is to do ordinary things in a simple way. The great things in evangelisation is to simply make yourselves attractive, make the Church beautiful.
So the best way actually to evangelise is not through proselytisation. To evangelise is to make ourselves attractive. So the Church was attractive because the Church was seen to autiful because we care for the poor,

the marginalised. If we want to evangelise again, we have to ask ourselves, how do we make our Church beautiful and attractive.
In order to evangelise, in order to do works of charity, we must recognise that the heart of the Church is the heart of love. The way to evangelise, first and foremost, is to realise that the Church is basically the heart of God's love. If there is love in our hearts,
we will evangelise. When you are motivated by love, you will do anything and give everything for love. If you want to be a real missionary for Christ, if you want to be a woman and a man of love, you will first need to love yourself, just as God loves you. God loves little children. Even though you might be little in the eyes of the world, in the eyes of God you are special, you are important.

If you claim that dignity, then you will stop comparing yourself with others. Then you will be at peace. Each one of us, we are called to serve God in our own ways, according to the charisms, according to whatever resources the Lord has given to you. If only you exercise and fully develop whatever potential the Lord has given to you, you will be happy anywhere and all the time because you know that is what the Lord wants of you.
