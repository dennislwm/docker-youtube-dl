It is in every man's DNA to seek for justice in life. We all want justice to be done to us and we will seek for redress when we have been wronged or we have been cheated. Underlying this issue of justice, there is a bigger issue we are called to face. It is the question of greed and attachment. Legally, something might belong to you but the question is, do you really need them? Is it worth fighting for the property or for the money that you feel belong to you. If we want something back because it is our entitlement then you ask yourself, first and foremost, how do we see our wealth, our money, our property in life?

Everything that we have, they do not belong to us, honestly. Everything we have belongs to God. God has given them to us. And therefore because everything belongs to God, it is our duty to ask ourselves, how do we make use of what God has given to us. And it is true,

whatever we have, therefore, is meant to be shared by all. Every human being on this earth has a right to the gifts of creation. Money,
at the end of the day, is to make friends,

is to build love, is to build friendship.
It is to help people. It is to empower people.

It is only when money is used in such a way that it will bring us great joy. When we can use money to enrich the lives of people, to make someone happy, that gives us a joy that money cannot buy. Contentment, really, is the key to happiness - receiving whatever the Lord has given to us and distributing what the Lord has blessed us with. Amen.
