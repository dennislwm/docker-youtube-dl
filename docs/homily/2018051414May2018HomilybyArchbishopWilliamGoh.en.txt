 therefore criteria to be an effective

 apostle the first thing if we want to be

 an apostle of Jesus we must first walk

 with him closely because we have not

 seen the Lord for ourselves if we have

 not encountered his love for ourselves

 how can we be a weakness and that is why

 intimacy of the Lord is the foundation

 of Christian mission what does it mean

 to be an apostle and also is one who is

 sent to be send means to say that we

 have been loved and what is this sending

 all about the sending is to tell people

 that Jesus is the love the mercy of God

 in person which we have seen and

 encountered for ourselves the second

 requirement to be an effective apostle

 is not only that we are loved

 we must continue to remain in love all

 your life the Scriptures are meant to

 help us to be faithful to the love of

 God we need guidelines we need

 inspiration within the guidance of the

 Lord and to be faithful to his

 commandment is to ensure that we remain

 in the ambit of course love and wisdom

 and to remain in his commandment also

 means that we must be in constant prayer

 especially those times when you are

 asked to make difficult decisions and

 the Lord will give you the size of what

 he wants you to do and thirdly if you

 want to be truly in unity of Jesus then

 you must be in union with your fellow

 Catholics fourth thing we are -</c> we must

 be in union with the church the

 Magisterial the Pope and the Apostles

 and the bishops to make sure that you

 will be taught in the truth so that you

 can remain in the truth so it is this

 and make us true bosses of Christ
