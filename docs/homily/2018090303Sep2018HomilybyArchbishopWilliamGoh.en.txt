 apologetics that means arguing about our

 faith has great limitations because at

 the end of the day you cannot prove to

 anyone that we are the true church or we

 are the true faith because faith

 basically is rooted in relationship it

 is about encounter you can prove to

 someone that you are the best person you

 can be the best in many ways but if

 there is no love without the person

 relationship no matter what we can say

 about God people will still not believed

 what was the basis of Jesus ministry it

 was because of his own encounter with

 the father's love and mercy that drove

 him for the mission his ministry the

 good news is not about doctrine the good

 news was simply the father is mercy and

 love it was Jesus own personal

 experience of the father's loved that

 was the basis of his mission if he

 really wants to bring people to Christ

 not so much using apologetics we all

 have to tell people simply who Jesus is

 Torrance how did Jesus change our lives

 it is telling people our own encounters

 with Jesus that would touch people's

 life testimony's not doctrines when

 people began to have faith in Jesus then

 doctrines becomes important when people

 are in love Jesus then this is where

 apologetics comes in apologetics are for

 those already who believe in

 price but they need to strengthen their

 faith even more to give foundation to

 their believed if you have not

 encountered Jesus love

 we cannot be Proclaimers of the good

 news if you love Jesus you will be a

 great theologian yourself because then

 you want to know more you want to study

 more and you want to lead others to him

 through love and through understanding
