 it is only in recent times that the

 church focuses on the New Evangelization

 important focus in the mission of the

 church we have to find new methods new

 expressions of the way we evangelize

 people's today and this is very

 important because of the changing

 situation in this world life has changed

 tremendously the way we look at life is

 very different from the way our parents

 have look at life how do we address the

 Parana values of the church the truth as

 we call to the modern person and that is

 why human visualization calls for a new

 methods and new expression new ways of

 engaging the people otherwise the church

 would be redundant the sacredness of God

 isn't is in the church God is present

 everywhere in the people whenever we

 love ever we serve and we also have to

 bring God's presence to the marketplace

 if the church wants to be relevant and

 we have to find also new language modern

 parables and they say Pope Francis's or

 you must go up we need to be more

 adventurous more creative more proactive

 and to find new ways be courageous
