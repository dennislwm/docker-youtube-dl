 my dear brothers and sisters in Christ a

 few days ago we just celebrated the

 Feast of the Ascension at the end of the

 gospel the law invited instructed his

 disciples to proclaim the good news to

 all of creation and to be his witnesses

 my dear brothers and sisters what is

 this good news that we are called to

 proclaim what are we called to witness

 to the truth is the good news is not

 reducible to merely right doctrines or

 even right morality or even liturgy and

 worshiped the good news is more than all

 these so what is this good news that we

 are called to communicate in today's

 scripture readings we are told the good

 news first and foremost is the Father's

 love for each one of us for all of

 humanity in fact the whole life of Jesus

 is to reveal the father's unconditional

 love and mercy for us all today the

 world many people that live see their

 orphans that is why the world is going

 into despair because people do not know

 the identity they did not know that

 there will be a future for them after

 this life on this earth and that is what

 Jesus said for the righteous one the

 world has not known you but I have known

 you and these have known that he has

 sent me I have made your name known to

 them and will continue to make it known

 so that the love with which you love me

 may be in

 and so that I may be in them so the good

 news really is that we are caught to

 share the same love that Jesus had from

 his father but the good news is more

 than the Father's love for us the good

 news in today's Gospel again Jesus said

 is that we are called to share in the

 glory of God remember simple tells us in

 Romans 3:21 all have sinned and fall

 short of the glory of God we are created

 to be the glory of God when people see

 us they see the presence of God in us

 our whole life is to glorify God that is

 what we pray in the Lord's Prayer by our

 words by our deeds but that is how we

 share the glory of God to be another

 Christ and Christ of course is the glory

 of the Father for this reason we are

 cool to share in the life of Jesus we

 have got to grow in the full maturity in

  Christ anyone who is in Christ has already

 shared the glory of God so I hope when

 you go about your friends your office

 colleagues can say to you wow the glory

 of God is here like Moses when he came

 down from the mountain he was totally

 transformed that is what we are called

 to be to share in his glory so that we

 might be the glory of God to others but

 there is not even all that is not the

 greatest the

 this glory you take note this is what

 Jesus said Jesus said I have given them

 the glory you gave to me that they may

 be one as we are one

 the ultimate glory that you and I are

 quarter share is to be one with God the

 Father and the son in the spirit because

 the glory of Jesus and that is what he

 said is that Jesus is one with his

 father the glory of God therefore refers

 to our union with God and it is on this

 basis because of our union with God we

 are one with each other that is why the

 unity of the world cannot be promoted

 without union with God this is the

 greatest mistake of the world today they

 want to promote unity among humanity

 without God God is the source of that

 unity that's why the world is in

 disarray relativism individualism

 pragmatism materialism simply because

 the world thinks they can achieve unity

 without God

 on the contrary Jesus is with me in them

 and you in me may they be so completely

 one that the world will realize it was

 you who sent me and that I've loved them

 as much as you loved me so my dear

 brothers and sisters this is the essence

 of the good news don't you think it is

 good news I think so

 you should think so my dear brothers and

 sisters if not what are we here the good news we don't have to be

 pessimistic we don't have to live our

 life in such a way that we lose the

 shine in our life every day is fun

 showing even when it's raining that is

 what it means to be a Christian

 a Christian is one who do this with

 great positivity in your life someone

 who is always looking forward and how do

 we do all this how can be weaknesses but

 one way we can be weaknesses of course

 the best way is our own personal life

 leaving the exemplary life I sense even

 that radiates the glory of God

 we are told as in Steven he saw the

 glory of God in heaven and he became the

 glory of God because of the way he lived

 his life the way he could he was

 convicted of the gospel the way he broke

 him the gospel we fought you in the face

 of opposition's he was not afraid and

 even when he was put to death since

 Steven we great courage and forgiveness

 prayed for his enemies and that is why

 the life of st.</c> Stephen it was his

 prayer that changed soul into Paul and

 soul who became Paul became the greatest

 communicator of the good news my dear

 brothers and sisters while it is very

 important that we spread the good news

 through our way of life in an

 interpersonal manner but how can we

 proclaim the good news to all of

 creation we don't have the give of

 bilocation you know we are not the

 resurrected Lord we cannot be everywhere

 so God is so kind

 as we survey today's world communication

 Sunday today mass media is the greatest

 opportunity for us to proclaim the good

 news to all of creation that is possible

 now for the world we proclaim to all and

 instantly immediately beside we've sow

 with images my dear brothers and sisters

 we are human beings we need to hear we

 need to touch

 we need to feel we need to see that is

 the reason why those of us and most of

 you prefer to watch YouTube we know than

 to listen to a homily is boring but you

 deal with pictures with all kinds of

 images that keep us alive that keep us

 attentive because that is how we connect

 with what is going on we can identify

 when we see when we feel when we hear today as we celebrate will communication

 Sunday God has given us this tremendous

 opportunity we are given the means to

 evangelize today my dear brothers and

 sisters the world is a global village

 even for me as a bishop even while

 addressing you I'm not just addressing

 you I'm addressing the whole world

 anybody can't listen to this homily that

 is the power of mass media and mass

 media my dear brothers and sisters have

 to be used in such a way because to

 proclaim the good news means to say it

 must be good news mass media must be

 used in such a way to enlighten people

 in the truth that is what mass media is

 all about seeking the truth enlighten

 people in the truth do for me

 for in the right values of life to

 encourage to enlighten people to heal to

 give hope to those who are broken those

 who are despondent you know these

 through the sharing of stories many

 lives are converted to the music that we

 hear we are inspired to carry on in life

 every morning when you are going to work

 you just have to turn on the radio music

 songs talks all these can help you that

 is why my dear brothers and sisters in

 case you do not know today we are going

 to launched the catholic SG radio so

 that all catholics from now on 24 hours

 a day seven days a week you can get

 connected with Jesus through songs

 through music reflections because we ask

 you to attend seminars and conference

 and retreat and fall further you know we

 are very busy people I wish is true them

 I agree we are very busy people

 oh no time to go for recollection now

 when you are driving when you are

 sitting the MLT when you are sitting the

 bus a no excuse no excuse instead of

 hearing all the gossips around you now

 you just put on your gear plug your

 earpiece and listen to the music that

 comes from God to give you peace to give

 inspiration that is what social media is

 all about we must use this digital

 network to really give power of live

 lives social media have to be used in such a

 way they promote unity don't allow the

 mass media to be a cause of division

 your family when you go for dinner

 together don't be on the handphone when

 we not well for some of you you go for

 dinner together but I Cielo eyes are on

 the phone

 not even on the food you don't know what

 even eating you're just eating but

 you're on the Fond the purpose of all

 this social media is actually for

 interaction for sharing for bonding and

 we need to keep it in that way if the

 media so social media is destroying the

 unity the bond between your loved ones

 then you have gone too far this way now

 in the iPhone now they tell you one big

 how many hours here on the screen er how

 many hours you have to be careful don't

 spend too many hours on the screen but

 it is important all the same that we

 must use it wisely because unfortunately

 and this is what is happening the world

 is using the social media the digital

 network all wrong they use them to

 destroy lives to promote in the

 individualism freedom and expanse of the

 common good of the society they distort

 news fake news they disseminate instead

 of during unity mutual understanding

 tolerance acceptance they are promoting

 violence they are promoting hatred

 promoting from promiscuity oh Christ

 of evil are generated by the social

 media but the digital media and there is

 why we need to fight against the wrong

 use of mass media as Catholics our

 responsibility is to make sure that

 these instruments this means of

 communication given to us by God be used

 for the good of humanity for the good of

 the individual don't allow social media

 to contaminate your mind especially the

 Michael Young people today and this is

 so dangerous because nowadays young

 people your parents I know your

 very busy and you're very happy now this

 time very cheap you don't have to go to

 buy any more toys just one is enough buy

 the iPhone give it to your son for years

 Oh everyday they ain't 98 on the Fond

 you don't need to buy other toys the one

 point because everything is inside the

 toy but you know the danger is that they

 are reading all kinds listening to all

 kinds of news and access all kinds of

 information they are confused

 no wonder today we are so many young

 people they are confused because they

 are not getting the right news they are

 not discerning my dear brothers and

 sisters and some even use a social media

 to destroy lives every time I read this

 social media the commenced this breaks

 my heart

 we don't use social media to destroy

 life to sentence people to condemn

 people to shame people even if they have

 made mistakes my dear brothers and

 sister come on who is not a sinner he

 want to cast a stone on someone make

 sure Jesus says you have no sin but we

 use social media it's not the kind of

 words they use as if they are the most

 holy person on this earth they have no

 sins everybody that sinner my dear

 brothers and sisters that is not the way

 in fact when people commit sin something

 is wrong yes they should be enlightened

 that is true but they not reached not

 being human later because when we

 humiliate them you would destroy their

 lives many of them commit suicide in the

 end is that how the way we use media

 precisely today the second reading we

 have the first reading from sin 7 the

 Sanhedrin were you were condemning since

 Stephen they were judges they would

 ing they were doing the Word of God

 by stoning him to the AFT they're

 misguided before these people my dear

 brothers and sisters to tell you the

 truth even we don't condemn them even if

 they are self-righteous and misguided in

 trying to seek justice for this will we

 don't condemn them because many of these

 people they are coming from the apply

 the anger they have a lot of resentment

 against the world like in society

 because they have suffered these people

 they need our loved as well that is why

 we are caught to be like st.</c> Stephen

 since Steven is really a good example

 one with a magic to never retaliating

 even under persecution even that's why

 even when he proclaim the truth people

 who attacked us you know I've been

 attacked many times you not left right

 now many arrows all yeah whenever we

 speak the truth there would be some

 people who are not for the truth they

 were try to put you down it's all the

  same we don't retaliate we speak the truth

 we've loved the charity to heal to

 lightened and for us to do all these my

 dear brothers and sisters all

 communicators of the good news Jesus

 makes it clear we need to be one with

 him we need to make Jesus the center of

 our lives

 if we are not connected with Jesus Jesus

 is the good news in person

 he is not just a good news so if we want

 to be really communicative good news to

 have the mind in the heart of Jesus then

 let us be connected with Jesus and that

 is what today the second reading

 thousands come that everyone who listens

 answer come then although are thirsty

 come all who wanted them the water of

 life and have it free

 diamond
