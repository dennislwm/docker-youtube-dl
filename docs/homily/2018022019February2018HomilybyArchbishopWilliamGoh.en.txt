 during the season of Lent very often we

 emphasized the importance of prayer

 almsgiving penance and fasting and we

 did we have fulfilled our duties in band

 but these are means not the end of that

 so it's very important and right from

 the outset to remember the goal of land

 the objective and what is the objective

 it is holiness to be holy is our

 vocation every Christian is called to

 holiness and what is holiness holiness

 is simply to live the life of God

 charity is the soul of holiness holiness

 therefore first and foremost means that

 we are taught to love especially those

 who are marginalized those who are poor

 because the Lord identifies because in

 our sufferings it pains our handy father

 when we are not taking care of each

 other charity first and foremost means

 that we live a life of justice justice

 is the basic foundation of charity

 justice means that we deal with our

 brothers and sisters in the fair

 in a just manner before we can even

 exercise charity are we just in a

 relationship are we doing our part so

 today as we serve a season of land on

 the first day let us keep our focus

 correct we need to grow in holiness

 become more and more like Jesus in loved

 in service so that others will see the

 Christ in us
