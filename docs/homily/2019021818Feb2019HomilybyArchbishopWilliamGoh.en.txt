Very often, when people sin, when people fail in their responsibilities in life, we tend to condemn them. And yet, the truth is that I can't believe that there are real sinners,

in the sense that they deliberately choose to do in full knowledge, in full understanding.

If only they understand the depth of their evil deed, they would have stopped. Sin is deceiving. Sin gives us the impression that something is beautiful, something is enticing,

because it looked attractive. And this is true for all the sins in the world. They all think in their minds that this is something that can bring them real happiness. Our heart is corrupt and therefore we cannot really see what is good and what is evil. But there is another kind of sin. It is not out of ignorance.
It is a more insidious sin. It's the sin of pride. Hypocrisy is what destroys us even more. God is all merciful. Even in spite of our sinfulness and hypocrisy, let us ask the Lord to open our minds, open our ears, so that we can be transformed in His time and according to His grace.
