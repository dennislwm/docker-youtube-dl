  by the way the fifth week of length is

 called passion time so he's speaking in

 the past fifth under of length was

 passion Sunday but now we transferred to

 Palm Sunday Palm Sunday and passion

 Sunday I'm much into money but actually

 passion fight begins last Sunday now in

 the fifth week of Lent we normally cover

 the crucifixes or images why do we cover

 the process

 this is ranged the church asked us to

 contemplate specially they cover the

 process it's very symbolic why because

 we are told Jesus hid himself promised

 not only is his divinity hidden from us

 his humanity is even hidden because

 remember in Isaiah 53 we are told that

 Jesus was totally the suffering servant

 was sketched he was like a warm moment

 totally disfigured so if you know how

 much Jesus he was not even a man so his

 humanity and divinity a cover from when

 you are in sin you cannot see the love

 until you remove your seat so those of

 us who are in sin you look at the

  crucifix nothing nothing moves you because you

 won't see the feeling of the process and

 all the other statues they are meant to

 help us to enter into this mystical

 contemplation of price because we look

 at the crucifix so often and the

 covering therefore is a beautiful

 reminder that because of our sins we are

 not with Jesus we cannot see him anymore

 at the same time it forces us is there

 looking at the images we are called to

 contemplate in our minds when you know

 how much God loves you

 on much Jesus suffered for you then you

 would change out of love not because you

 have to if only you understand how much

 God loves me and all the statutes are

 covered also do because if the glory of

 the Lord is covered so then the servants

 were also doing exist the servants are

 nothing without the master and then on

 Good Friday when the cross is unveiled

 then again what we see now mine now what

 we contemplate in your mind now mean

 real and of course Easter Vigil Ithaca

 all the cloth you know to show that the

 glory of God is now shining
