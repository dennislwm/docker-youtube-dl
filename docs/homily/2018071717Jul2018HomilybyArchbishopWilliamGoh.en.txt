 and so we can see how our house was

 really afraid of for his self of course

 and for his people most of us we would

 think through the problem logically and

 we apply a logical solution and so for

 him there was of course the Syria a

 Syria was a powerful nation and so he

 fought alliance with Assyria it was a

 question of whether the country would be

 taken over by around and the north or

 have an alliance of Assyria as protected

 and of course Isaiah was sent to him and

 said to him you don't have to worry Aram

 and the northern kingdom cannot subdue

 you that was his promise God promised

 the king of Judah it will happen but you

 see he was short-sighted in bringing at

 the Assyrian what happened was that he

 lost control of the country and the

 country was weakened by Assyria and so

 this is what is happening in the world

 today because of fear lack of faith we

 take short-sighted solution quick

 decisions it's just like what the world

 is doing today we are trying to pander

 to the needs of people what people want

 we want to be happy but perhaps we have

 not seen the long-term consequences we

 only thinking about my knees my knees

 today but we're not thinking in terms of

 20 30 40 50 years down the road

 although it is true that our house was

 driven by fear but the real problem at

 the end of the days we can be driven by

 fear if we are not proud enough at least

 we still could respond to the Word of

 God so it was ultimately not fear that

 destroyed him

 it was right because Isaiah spoke to him

 and he refused to accept and today in

 the gospel Jesus again -</c> no he said alas

 corazon that side up and Jesus said you

 know because of the apply because they

 thought highly of themselves then they

 will have a great fall

 you know boo a proverb says you know

 pride goes before every destruction and

 the hardest haughty spirit before every

 downfall and so today we are asked and

 reminded we know not exalt ourselves too

 highly don't think too highly of

 ourselves we must know our place in life

 our position in life that's why we need

 to pray for humility otherwise a

 judgment of God on us would be what we

 call great and we'll be serviced so

 praying for human T is very important

 and that is why today I left this last

 line from prophet Isaiah you see if it

 not stand by me you will not stand at

 all so the disdain with the Lord in

 times of difficulties that is pray and

 that is also be humble that we truly

 have the courage to listen to the Lord

 and to do what he a service
