 the scripture readings invite us to

 reflect on how can one come to faith in

 Christ firstly it is important to take

 note faith is a gift from God this veil

 is given to everyone and this failed

 that is given is a freedom you cannot

 buy it

 the keeper failed does not respect rank

 and status in order to find failed

 person famos we need to be desperate

 that's what many people cannot

 experience God because they are

  self-sufficient only those who thirst for God will fight

 him even though we'll need for God you

 cannot encounter him unless she realize

 that you are nobody that God is

  everything only then God will show you his face so

 the dispositions are necessary humility

 docility a desperate need for God but

 how is being transmitted first and

 foremost it is true those who have lived

 so there are many people around us they

 do not have been why because they have

 not encountered people of faith so all

 we need to do in order to strengthen

 people to encourage people to grow in

 faith is to share update and God will

 work through ordinary ways and all you

 have to do is in faith claim the healing

 grace of God and Suman dear brothers and

 sisters let us be people of

 so that we can lead others to failed
