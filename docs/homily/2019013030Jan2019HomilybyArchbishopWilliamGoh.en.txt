 many people they want to encounter God

 and they cannot encounter him

 what is the reason because they are on

 the outside they are not in the inside

 we cannot have passion for the gospel so

 long as we are outside unless we enter

 the mind in the heart of Jesus you will

 never be able to share his mission

 effectively so most of us unfortunately

 we are hearing the gospel from the

 outside we are observers we are

 participants but we don't really can

 turn into the heart of Jesus we cannot

 feel with him and so how can we enter

 into the heart in the mind of Jesus the

 way to enter the mind and heart of Jesus

 contemplate on this but first and

 foremost we must first begin by reading

 the Word of God

 even if you are gone for all the Bible

 studies us do outside they are just pre

 route to prayer the unlock breath is

 more important to pray the Word of God

 then gets to study and to read it and

 this is actually the heart of entering

 into the mind of God that is why the

 church recommends us a devotional method

 of reading the scriptures

 lectio divina ignition contemplation is

 a devotional way of reading the

 scriptures and makes the scriptures

 comes alive so it is this devotion this

 encountering God with the heart that

 changes life not the hate so you can

 have plenty of intellectual knowledge it

 is you outside unless your heart is

 touched then it is inside and that is

 why through the

 must spring from the Word of God must

 spring from the liturgy and liturgy and

 the Word of God must live with emotions

 these two must go together how do you

 want to encounter Jesus in a real

 personal way is through the Word of God

 and to the celebration liturgy this is

 how we encountered a lot
