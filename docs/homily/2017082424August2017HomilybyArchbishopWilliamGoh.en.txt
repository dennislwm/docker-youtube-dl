 in life we see things very differently

 because of the fact that we are

 conditioned beings be a conditioned by

 our knowledged all of us have different

 levels of knowledge of any area in life

 so everybody will have different levels

 of knowledge and for that reason the

 limited knowledge that we have will

 curtail us from looking at the situation

 in the broader perspective but most of

 all we are conditioned by our life

 experiences this is the most important

 dimension or the way we look at life

 most of us we look at life through our

 past experiences so whether we like it

 or not all of us we are conditioned

 creatures and therefore it is good for

 us to recognize that we have limitations

 and so don't everything that we know

 everything and that is why there is this important attitude of being open being

 receptive and to recognize that yeah a

 person is somehow determined by his own

 experiences and his knowledge it's not

 for us to judge because you are not in

 that situation

 and this is important for us because we

 are called to build bridges we are

 called to build unity within the church

 you find that not Annelle is a very good

 example of a person who built bridges

 who is ready to overcome his all citizen

 and enter into dialogue he was not

 afraid of being open to new experiences

 in life and so how do we overcome how do

 we break barriers the first thing is to

 break barriers those of us who have that

 experience we must learn to invite

 Makana see is to enter into the same

 experience to be open to the experience

 so the the invite must be gentle and the

 person who is being caught also must

 respond once the person is has accept

 the invitation

 and we must encourage the person so life

 is such do you know if we find that we

 are handling sometimes or different

 people the first thing is to make them

 feel loved if you accept that now not to

 flatter them to bring the goodness out

 of the person when you bring the

 goodness of the person the person

 becomes he will break down his defense

 he will put out his defenses and so this

 is how we help people to break what we

 call the defenses to break down their

 barriers and this is how we promote

 unity and and this is what we should do

 at home before friends and especially

 when one bring people to come know Jesus
