 the fire that Jesus has come to bring to

 this earth it's not just the fire of

 purification that is also one symbol of

 fire but the fire that Jesus speaks

 about is also the fire of love to bring

 the fire of love to all humanity it's

 not something that is easy because loved

 always requires purification those who

 loved needs be purified and those who

 are being loved also needs purification

 being a Christian being loving is not so

 simple because there will always be

 people who will misunderstand us even

 when we do good we will be misunderstood

 even when we try to love we will also be

 misunderstood or we become a threat to

 others and so this is where today again

 we are called to remind ourselves that

 the baptism that we have undertaken is a

 baptism that requires us to continually

 die to ourselves

 it is a commitment and baptism is not

 something that we take upon ourselves

 spontaneously there are implications

 there are sacrifices but many of us as

 I've said we undertake a vocation we

 undertake a job or we undertake a

 commitment without thinking true every

 vocation requires this baptism ongoing

 baptism of purifying ourselves in love

 lying to ourselves when we don't choose

 Christ when we choose evil when you

 choose selfishness when we choose

 self-centeredness we become miserable

 life has no meaning life has no purpose

 I mean peace is most important because

 to know that you have done the right

 thing sometimes it's a joy you know you

 are this truth you know but you have

 done the right thing there is peace in

 your heart there is joy I don't feel

 that I'm a prayer

 best viewed Liberator there even in

 sacrifices in being misunderstood well

 at least we know that we have done the

 right thing and we have been courageous

 so I think it is this joy that we should

 focus on
