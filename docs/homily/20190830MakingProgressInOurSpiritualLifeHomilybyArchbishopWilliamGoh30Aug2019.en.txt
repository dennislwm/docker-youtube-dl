Very often, we take for granted our spiritual life. Holiness is an ongoing process. Holiness is not something that we achieve once and for all. Holiness is a journey that we take. There is no question of "I maintain my state of life". If you lose zeal in your mission, if you lose zeal in your ministry, if you lose the zeal of loving people, very soon you'll become very distant. If we don't make time for one another to share our life,
to share our joys, to share our sorrows, to share our aspirations, after some time we no longer feel for each other and with each other. Each one will be living their own life. And that is really sad. So faith is like a relationship. We can never take faith for granted. We don'ake relationship for granted. Relationship is an investment.

Faith is an investment. We need to make time no matter how busy we are.

While we say the church is growing, it looks like, but actually how many members are really passionate in their faith? We need to take our spiritual lives seriously. Otherwise you will lose your zeal. This journey is a long-drawn journey. There is no question of proxy in terms of relationship with God. You have to start praying yourself, you have to start reading the Word of God. There is no proxy to go to Heaven. Either you go in yourself or you don't.

So today, let us pray that we will stay awake, so that we'd be ready when the Lord comes. We'd be ready so that as we grow in holiness, we also can grow in wholesomeness.
