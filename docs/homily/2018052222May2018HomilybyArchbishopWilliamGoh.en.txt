 so my dear brothers and sisters sin

 James in the first reading identify the

 course of much unhappiness

 and division among ourselves he said

 where do these wars and battles between

 yourself first start and the course is

 simple because of these desires in our

 hearts and that causes division ambition

 seems to be a good way to motivate a

 person but having an ambition is not

 good enough because ambition tends to be

 sub centered it is focused on our

 achievement on what I can do on what I

 can receive on how successful I am

 ambition is basically about self even

 when it's ambition to serve others what

 is true ambition but a Christian

 ambition is not about serving ourselves

 the Christian ambition is about serving

 others that makes a difference so that's

 why even when you got your surrender

 you got people to be ambitious we need

 to have some kind of ambition that is

 true but the ambition must be purified

 must be correctly good debated the only

 ambition that can really truly gives you

 life is when you are ambitious for the

 sake of others it's not about yourself

 focus is not about building your kingdom

 building your glory

 the focus is about how can we make

 life's better

 the focus is about how can we build

 society how can we make God known and

 loved the focus is how can we have

 people how can we elevate the situation

 poverty of injustice so the focus is on

 actually building up people building up

 society that is the only ambition that

 is truly a Christian ambition today in

 the gospel

 and Jesus reminds us of the importance

 of service and indeed our st.</c> James want

 us that if we give ourselves generously

 to God God would be generous to us and

 he will give also generously to society

 Society will always be generous to you

 Sen Jim says resist the devil and let us

 have a clear mind don't have double mind

 you cannot be wavering but most of all

 we need to be focused and so that is

 pray that we will make sure that our

 ambition is for people for God net for

 servants specially your sure and very

 important huh

 so it's good to us ourselves you know

 for the greater glory of God for the

 greater glory of the people for the

 service of people we must put ourselves

 aside so for me what that way too easy

 for the greater good is for the greater

 good if we give ourselves then the Lord

 will bless
