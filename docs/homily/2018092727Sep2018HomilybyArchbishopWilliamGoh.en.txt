When you look back in your life and you begin to wonder for all the toils that you have put in, what is the outcome?

And it can be very disheartening especially when you give yourself freely.

You ask yourself, so much work has been put into it, so much sacrifices.

And then you look at your family, you look at your organisation, then you wonder, "Have I really made a difference?

Is there a change for the better?"

Or whether the efforts we have put in is futile.

So what do we do?

Should we give up?

The point is precisely, we should not give up.

We should still continue.

We leave it into the hands of God.

All we can do is to recognise that success is dependent on God.

We need to be true to what we believe in,
because otherwise the guilt will come back to haunt you and there will be no peace.

We need to be focused.

We need to be clear of what we are doing.

So what is important for us is that we do what we can, live by our conscience and then surrender everything to God.

God is in charge and so we entrust our world to Him.
