How do we find happiness in life? Contentment is the key to happiness.

It is neither good to be poor or to be too rich. Just be moderate. That is the key to happiness. In life, whatever we have we enjoy, if we don't have it's okay.

We cannot be attached to all these things because at the end of the day, it is relationship that is more important.
Don't be too ambitious in life. When you have no ambition then you don't feel sad if things are not doing well, if things are not going your way. And so this is where the Lord invites us today to keep our focus. We pray that God  will give us the grace to be guided by the Word of God, so that we will always be able to be clear, free of ambition but be committed to our mission, committed to our work, doing all that we can,

conscience is clear. If you have done your best, don't worry about the result.

The Lord will take care.
