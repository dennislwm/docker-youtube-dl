  in the gospel we have the story of this  rich man he was dressed in purple and  fine linen and feasted cently every day  this richmond was reached in pleasure in  wealth in luxurious living but nowhere  in a gospel have we read that this  rich man was rich in love rich in mercy rich  in compassion rich in kindness he might  be enjoying the things of this world it  is true he did no harm he didn't do  anything wrong but he was just absorbed  in himself and that is why in today's  first reading prophet Jeremiah says a  curse on the man who relies on things of  flesh whose heart turns from the Lord  this rich meant he was reached but he  was not even given a name that is why  those people who are reached and  oblivious to the sufferings of the poor  they cannot find a fullness of life no  matter how much riches you have how much  material comfort you have they do not  live life to the fullest yet it is  important for us to clarify it is not  wrong to be reached if the Lord has  blessed you with riches with wealth with  positions in life we should be grateful  the scene of this rich man was not  because he was reached but he cause he  was blind to Lazarus the poor man who  was right in front of his gate not to  say that he was far  a remote some way Timbuktu  he was right in front and he was not  bothered about him and his sufferings  and so this is why it's important for us  to recognize that the richmond was  really a poor man because god wants us  all to be reached we become reached when  we share the loved that he has given to  us with others we become truly reached  when we are in love with everyone the  man who is really in communion with his  brothers and sisters  he is truly a reached man and so it is  very interesting that in today's Gospel  the symbol of true riches is Abraham of  course we know that Abraham in the book  of Genesis he was a rich land he had  many flocks of sheep and cattle but he  was not attached to his wealth he was  generous he gave 10% Pike's to God and  when his nephew Lord Hertz men were  squabbling with his own people over the  pasture ground he told his nephew Lord  choose whichever lend you one you go not  I go south you go east I go west he was  not attached even though he was a rich  man and of course also we know that  Abraham was well known for his  generosity in the Bible he was an  example of what hospitality is all about  he would sit at his tent  whenever visitors pass by he would stop  them he welcomed them he even behave  like a servant wash the feet of his  guests repair them a meal and that's why  a lot of Hebrews we are told he even  entertained the three angels when they  came by unconsciously  so it is not surprising therefore when  Lazarus died Lazarus was taken up into  the bosom of Abraham where there is  peace love joy and welcome the bosom of  Abraham is a symbol of one who welcomes  everyone the bosom is a symbol of love  of embracement and so today when we talk  about Abraham we can imagine because he  was always welcoming everyone who would  be with Abraham of course Lazarus he was  in the heart of Abraham and yet my dear  brothers and sisters this is where is  important for us to understand the  contrast that the gospel gives to us we  are taught that a rich man he said to  Abraham who was a long way off we are  told he saw Lazarus in his bosom and he  said father Abraham pity me because I am  in agony in this flames this is what  hell is all about what is  is  the agony to be in agony is in hell but  is  is when everyone is  your friend heaven is when you are in  love with everyone  heaven is when you are in communion with  everyone the rich man was cut off from  Abraham because he was in hell he was  not able to be in communion with Abraham  and all those good people there that's  why he was in agony not because of the  flames is the flames of hatred of a  lineage of being self-absorbed that is  what hell is about when you have no  friends when you an enemy to everybody  or when you consider everybody your  enemy you are in hell that is a  foretaste of hell and so that is why the  rich man was really in a place of  torment he was all   captain  hell is to continue to dwell on  ourselves those of you who would like to  engage in self-pity and that is healthy  way to people engage in self-pity  oh poor me suffering so much if you stop  thinking about yourselves and you start  thinking about others you will not  indulge in self-pity because there are  more people suffering than you those  people who are engaged in self-pity is  just like the rich men absorbed in  himself but if you reached out you find  your life liberated and this is what we  are called to do that is why today  during the season of Lent we are called  to reach out to the poor especially to  the suffering to pay attention to those  people who are hurting those who are  lonely  incidentally did you know Caritas and  st. Vincent DePaul they told me they  missed their collections because we  don't have masses on Sundays so perhaps  you want to think how to contribute you  know your little token if I can   so that you can be like  Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham the poor  does it or because no masters no need to  give you see you can give online because  precisely the rich band set good Abraham  can you please send a warning and  Abraham says no need to what for I come  back even if the date were rice also  they won't believe so dear brothers and  sisters that is not hard in our hearts  don't say you know because you didn't  attend Mass you are exempted from caring  for the poor so that is repent that s turn to Abraham for inspiration event
