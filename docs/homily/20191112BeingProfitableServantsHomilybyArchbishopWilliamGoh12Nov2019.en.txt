 it is very important for us to be

 grateful for what we have in order to be

 happy in life we must be used fully if

 you are usefully the potentials are

 we'll explore and tap on you become much

 better your life is more rich more

 energized because you are being used to

 the food when you are used less then

 your life is incomplete so happiness in

 life is to be used to the food and that

 is what it means but useful and what

 they mean by useless useless means you

 are used less when you work to do

 actually it gives you like giving birth

 verb if you meaning God has created us

 in His image and likeness we are taught

 to love and to be like him in service in

 love and it is in the process of loving

 of course we are purified so even work

 that we do is a purification of love

 it's a purification of multipe it's part

 of growing up when you are useful God

 would know how to be waters if we are

 always used to the food we will always

 shine out because we are actually

 maximizing our potentials you find

 purpose and God bless you that way so

 let us thank God that we are the

 servants and at the end of the day a

 master is really the real servant who is

 a master the master is the servant of

 servants my pastor Bishop is to serve

 you to help you to be better servants to

 others if you are boss what is your task

 to help those under you to be effective

 servants and we serve the servants by

 helping them to explore their potentials

 to see what the good earth to empower

 them to enrich them to encourage them

 that is what the master is and the

 master actually is the chief servant

 that's why the holy father comes out

  a master is not one who

 dominate a master is not one to control

 the master is not one who tell me what

 to do

 the master is trying to help the

 servants to become master so that they

 too can help other servants and that is

 what Jesus does for us there's mine he

 washed the feet of his Cyprus and he

 said to them whatever I do to you

 do unto others
