Are we really faithful to the Gospel that has been passed on to us, or have we changed the Gospel to suit our own philosophies in life, to suit our own lack of faith in Jesus?

Do we really believe? Do we affirm this in our own faith in Jesus? If not, then we are not faithful to the Gospel. The reason why our missionary evangelical zeal is weak among Catholics, among Christians, is because we have forgotten the Gospel. It is because we have compromised the Gospel. We are no more believing exactly what the Gospel has been given to us. If we are in union with Jesus'
mind, heart and soul, we can be sure that Jesus will bring our work to fruition. Jesus for us is the wisdom of God, the power of God. And if we go back to the Gospel, then indeed our work of evangelisation will be fruitful. Otherwise our faith remains another philosophy in life.
