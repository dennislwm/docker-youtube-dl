Very often today, people want to live the fullness of life. But for many people in the world, to live life to the fullest means to try all kinds of adventures, enjoy everything in this world. And this is where the world is wrong, because very often the world reduces the fullness of life in terms of satisfying our body. The fullness of life is not about ourselves. The fullness of life is lived when we begin to live for others. It is about caring for people,

it is about loving people, it is about serving people, it is about making people happy. And in the process of reaching out,
in the process of giving our lives in service to others, we find great joy. And so, this is our calling, actually. And the question is, how then do we come out of ourselves, not to be too absorbed in our own selves, in our own need, but to be really absorbed and to be focused on the needs of others. If we believe in Jesus, we will never die, so long as we give our lives in service to others. So even though as we are dying to ourselves in the process of serving others, actually we live.
Those people who are afraid to die to themselves, actually these are the people who are fearful of death. They are fearful of giving and so they deprive themselves of the fullness of life that is being offered to them. If you believe that life continues hereafter, if we know that our life is a continuity, there is a life beyond this life, then there is no fear of death. And because of that, we can give our life to the fullest, even to the point of death. And to live is to love.
And to love selflessly presupposes we believe that Jesus is the Resurrection and the Life.
