As with all religions, our task is to ensure that the common good are looked after. So we have to articulate our voice. We have to articulate our views when it comes to values that will affect the integral growth, the holistic growth of every human person. If there is no ethical guidelines on using science and technology, the country will be destroyed by science and technology, because people will abuse technology and use it for their own interests rather than for the good of everyone. And so our task is to help in issues that will ensure that in the long run and not just in the immediate present, that society will be protected, that families will be protected,
that people will live holistic lives. And no one can happy unless you are holistically developed. So at the end of the day, is your life meaningful? Is your life enriching? Are you living for others? If you are just living for yourself, there is no happiness. This is where religion comes in. And religion is important. Because at the end of the day,
God wants us all to be happy.
