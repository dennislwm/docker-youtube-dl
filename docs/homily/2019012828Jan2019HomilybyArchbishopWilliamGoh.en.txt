 all of us have to recognize that the

 devil is real in our lives our sins are

 not just committed by human beings but

 it is also under the prompting of the

 evil wand that is the reason why we have

 to be on guard against the evil wand so

 that we will not fall into his walls

 into his snares into his traps that is

 one way to be an accomplice of the evil

 one to support the world values against

 the gospel the other way we become

 accomplices of the evil one is this when

 we fight against one another how come we

 are not alert to these temptations of

 the evil one

 because of the darkness of our soul but

 is this scene that cannot be forgiven

 when we are no longer sensitive to the

 prompting of the Holy Spirit the

 prompting of God because many of us we

 get used to our sin one sin leads to

 another sin and when we can no longer

 see our own sins that is a blasphemy

 against the Holy Spirit we will

 participate in the sacrifice of Christ

 that every icarus will find strength to

 participate the sacrifice of Christ

 means we want to die to ourselves died

 for our sins and is receiving Holy

 Communion as you listen to the Word of

 God this is how we grow in our faith

 this is how we can most sensitive to the

 Holy Spirit always listening to the Word

 of God and as you receive Holy Communion

 we become more United as one body of

 Christ and so if we want to conquer

 Satan if we want to conquer our sins not

 alone together supporting one another in

 our spiritual life supporting one

 another in growing our faith then we

 will be able to win this battle against

 that you will want do not walk alone

 walk with your fellow Catholics what if

 Jesus
