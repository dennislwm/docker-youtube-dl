The traditions that we have in every culture,
in every religion, in every nationality, they are expressive of values that are supposed to be transmitted through signs and through symbols. We cannot do without tradition. And don't ever think that you can be faithful to the Word of God without keeping the traditions.
The traditions must not contradict the Word of God. The Word of God is more than the Bible.
The Word of God refers to what the Lord has passed on to us. The written Word, it has a very special place in the sense that it is inspired. And it is written, therefore,
it has become a rule of reference, a point for reference, because what is written remains stable. And yet the Word of God, the Bible so to speak, they cannot present the whole Jesus, because Jesus is more than the Bible.

And the end of the day, what we need to do is to transmit Jesus to everyone. And to transmit Jesus requires more than just the words. To transmit Jesus, we also need to enter into the heart of Jesus. So it's very important for us to be clear, when we talk about Sacred Tradition, it encompasses the Word of God.
But it is not just the written Word, it encompasses the entire Jesus. One way to transmit Jesus is through preaching, because it is in preaching that we come to share our encounters with Jesus, our experience of Jesus. And so it's important at the end of the day, whatever tradition, I think we have to ask ourselves,

is it against the spirit of the Word of God?
Is it against Christian values? Then we know whether that tradition could be inculturated or has been wrongly inculturated. It is important to ask, the traditions that we have, do they lead people to a deeper appreciation of the Gospel, a deeper encounter with Jesus?
