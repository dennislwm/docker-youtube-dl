 today the Scripture readings invites us

 to reflect how it should believe a life

 of holiness a life of holiness is

 manifested differently at different

 times in the history of the church and

 in our own life we don't have one

 spirituality that fits all everybody

 would have to ask themselves how they

 can walk the life of the Spirit you need

 to find your own way to respond to the

 spirit how do we translate the teachings

 of Jesus in our everyday life according

 to the situation when you look at the

 history of the church the history of the

 church we have 2,000 years of

 spirituality and whatever kind of

 spirituality you want is that we draw

 our spirituality from Jesus the

 salvation that comes from Jesus is

 basically to him is the only god man who

 can reconcile us and he's only one who

 can teach us how to live an authentic

 human life because Jesus was truly man

 he was truly God if we want to live a

 holy life which is a holistic life then

 it's very important that we bring the

 two dimension of our human person

 together keep them in balance all the

 time because it's very important to help

 us to realize that the body expresses

 itself through the spirit this link

 between the body and spray -</c> is so real

 that many of us forget that holiness

 holiness does not mean simply to take

 half of our soul they care for spirit

 because the body will also influence the

 spirit now if you don't have enough

 grass you can't pray if you don't keep

 the kind of spirit if you do not pray

 you don't make time to read the Word of

 God you don't make time to be to be

 alone with the law to have some quiet

 time for yourself

 we all need private space you know we

 need some time together they're not

 always with people all the time you need

 to have time for you to recollect

 so so that you can be focused so they

 can be scented so they can get easy in

 fact if you find that you are very

 restless you're very irritable it simply

 means that you need time for yourself

 and by yourself to be with a lot so if

 you don't take care of spirit your body

 would be affected holiness at the other

 day as same policy is to sanctify your

 body your signification body means to

 look after your body well you love your

 body is to love God actually it's a

 sanctify yourself because it's good for

 your health holiness is the tip of

 Allens in everything we do so that our

 bodies can really send be a source of

 glory for God
