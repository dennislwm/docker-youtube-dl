  we are approaching nearer to the Paschal  mystery which we will celebrate in Holy  Week the first few days of the fourth  week of Lent  Jesus was portrayed as a life giver he  brought people to life in contrast we  find the enemies of Jesus wanting to put  him to death  my dear brothers and sisters we see the  beginning of hostility in the life of  Jesus the hostility gets more and more  fierce over the days until it will end  in his theft the persecution of Jesus is  not new to rest as well because as  Christians we are always persecuted from  the beginning of the founding of  Christianity from our master our Lord  Jesus Christ the primitive  Christians during time the Roman Empire Christians  have always been persecuted this  persecution has not ended even today we  find a Christian teachings are being  questioned by many people in the world  vicinity promotes the culture of life  vicinity promotes authentic living  strong family life strong marriages yet  all these are being challenged by the  world today the world opposes the gospel  values what are the reasons the  first reason as we are told in today's first  reading one book of wisdom the godless  say to themselves with a misguided  reasoning the truth is that many people  if they against  the Catholic faith and the gospel many  of them are actually ignorant they are  sincere but ignorant we cannot blame  such people because they have all kinds  of information today from the mass media  social media so much things to read ternet  so much sort of people are  confused today it is very difficult for  the ordinary men and women to know what  is truth what is right what is wrong  because you get messages from everywhere  and all these messages a lot of  half-truths distorted truth very few  people will verify whatever they read  most people will just take it wholesale  because we don't have the time to verify  every information we received and so it  is true Catholic teachings have often  been misrepresented and of course  sometimes by our own Catholics as well  we also a cause of this confusion and  because people misunderstand what we are  teaching why we believe certain things  then of course these people they are  misled but there is another group of  people who are opposing the gospel  simply because we are a reprimand to  their way of life and that is what they  said in the first reading again we are  told not only they are misled but many  of them precisely because the author  said we are reproof to their way of  thinking our very sight will weigh their  spirit down because our life is not  their way of life so is their lifestyle  that is being challenged and of course  today in the world of relativism no one  wants to be seen as doing something that  is not  everybody is normal no one is abnormal  no one is doing the wrong thing and so  when their lifestyle is being challenged  by the gospel it is natural for them to  defend themselves to react then there is  a third group of people who are opposed  to the gospel this group of people  they want to normalize what is irregular they  want to normalize same-sex marriage  transgender they want to normalize drug  addiction drug consumption they want  to normalize u10 easier abortion even to  the last day in the womb of the mother  so that people cannot say something is  wrong and that is the truth today the  world wants to change the larger  community the way we look at life so  that after some time the larger  community if you subscribe to a  particular viewpoint you will be the  abnormal one so this is why the gospel  is being opposed people want to  normalize evil today then there is  the fourth group of people these are the  people that are the most dangerous these  are the people that are malicious as the  book of wisdom tells us they do not know  the hidden things of God they have no  hope that holiness will be rewarded and  so these people they want to destroy  humanity because of selfishness it's all  about themselves  my pleasure now my happiness I want my  desires to be fulfilled those offers who  are advocating moral relativism those of  us who are advocating materialism we  have to ask ourselves whatever we do in  life easy just for ourselves here and  now or do we think of the future  of humanity do we care for our family do  we care for strong marriages in the  future do we care for children that are  brought up in family we have holistic  formation do we care for the country  that people will be generous that we  support each other actually certainly  speaking there is no point in this world  it's the rich that are grabbing  everything for themselves you know if  you read the report every year so much  food is wasted and the food could have  supported 800 million of people the  amount of food we throw away there is  not work it is selfishness  it is about ourselves but you know my  dear brothers and sisters at the end the  day let us not blame the world there is  nothing that we are always being  attacked by the world I think the  greatest obstacle in living the gospel  in proclaiming the gospel is not because  people outpost the gospel the real  problem is we as Catholics we are  counter witnesses we are not true to  what we believed in we like integrity of  faith and life that is why today again  in the first reading what did the enemy  said he says let us see what he says is  true let us observe what kind of end he  himself have he calls himself the Son of  God he claims to have knowledge of God  that is what we do we claim we are  children of God we claim to have  knowledge of God but do we walk the way  of truth look at the scandals in the  church today the scandals of pedophilia  the cover-up of authorities all these  have causes to lose credibility so it's  not because the world does  not agree with us in the first place  because the world has no more confidence  in us because we are not credible so we  actually the cause of our own downfall  not our enemies in fact I need miss make  us stronger because if they are truly  our enemies we will come together  we will have greater faith but because we  ourselves like faith we ourselves are  not united in faith we are not convinced  of our faith we just pay lip service we  are children of God we are sons of God  but we don't live that kind of life  that's why today in the gospel we have  Jesus he knew himself he said you do not  know where I come from  I  have come from him and it was he who  sent me jesus was conscious of his  identity as the Son of God he  was conscious of his mission and that was  the reason why the Lord was not afraid  to stand up against his enemies my dear  brothers and sisters if we want to walk  that way of truth and life if we want to  claim ourselves to be children of God  then this is what we are called to do to  be authentic in our faith imitating Jesus our Lord
