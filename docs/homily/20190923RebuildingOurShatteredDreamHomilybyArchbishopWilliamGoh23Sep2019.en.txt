We know that the spread of Christianity was the result of missionaries. And not only they brought the Gospel to the whole world, missionaries also brought with them the gifts of love,

the gifts of charity. Today, we are challenged to play our part in announcing the Gospel.

Instead of condemning the darkness, we light a lamp. The world is changing. What is wrong today has been normalised. What was considered abnormal, now is normalised. You notice how the world normalise evil through desensitisation.
And because why? We keep quiet and they are the one who is speaking all the time on the TV, on the media, entertainment. That is how society uses the media to tell us it's a norm.
For us who are believers in God, it becomes absurd. We are not normal. What was considered normal is now considered abnormal. And why?

Because we have not announced the Good News.
Let us pray that we have the courage to return to the Gospel. We have to return to Jesus,
because Jesus is the foundation. We have to return to the Word of God because if we don't do anything, if you don't announce the Good News, then the world will secularise us. And then we'll lose our faith.
