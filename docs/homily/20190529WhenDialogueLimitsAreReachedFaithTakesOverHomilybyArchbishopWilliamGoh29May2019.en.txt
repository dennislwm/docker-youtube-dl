How best should we proclaim the Gospel? What are the methods? Which way is more effective?

Everybody is looking for love. Everybody is looking for meaning and for purpose. So we begin with that. So we begin with issues that invite us to reflect further. That is the starting point. Inter religious dialogue does not aim at conversion, we have to be very clear. ter religious dialogue, everybody goes in with the same conviction of their religion. Inter religious dialogue is for those who are mature in faith, who knows their faith, who are convicted and they come together with something to share about their faith,

so that what we share will inspire each other to be more committed to our own faith, so that we begin to appreciate our own faith.
At the same time, we begin to appreciate what we have in common. That is called inter religious dialogue. And then we can also have respect for one another. And that is what 'Nostra aetate' asks us to do. In this way, we have in a broad manner, built a community of love.
Because at the end of the day, the Gospel is to build a community, a family of God.
And so, by promoting community, by promoting unity among other religions, in a certain sense we have also permeated the Gospel values in the lives of our fellow men. The work of evangelisation is simply to announce the Good News. There is no other way to bring people to have faith in Jesus, except to let people know what Jesus has done for us in our lives,
the difference He has made in our lives. And then when people see the difference that Jesus has made in your life, they see the love in you, they see the forgiveness in you, then they too might begin to think, "I think there could be something in your religion. Something perhaps I would like to explore."
