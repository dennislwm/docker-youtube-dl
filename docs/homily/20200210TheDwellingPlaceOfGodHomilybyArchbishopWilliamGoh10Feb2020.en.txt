  the real danger having a church is that  it leads to a dichotomy between faith  and life we tend to domesticate God as  if God only lives in the church God is  Emmanuel he is everywhere Jesus was  always living in the midst of his people  the pupi that Jesus preached was not in  a synagogue it was in the desert in the  wasteland it was at the seashore he was  Jesus in his preaching he was always  with the people with the sick with the  needy Jesus was the presence of God in  himself and he carries the presence  wherever he went  although we need a church to encounter  God we must realize this and is very  important that all of us we must be the  living presence of God to others  after worship we must depart to serve after  praying and worshipping God that we must  be able to find and recognize the  presence of God in our fellow men in  those who are sick in those who are  suffering in those who are even  difficult people we are caught to be  God's encouraging word we are caught to  be the one who can lift up people from a  pain from depression we are off accord  to offer a word of encouragement these  are the ways in which we make God  present and so please that is not  confined God in the church only and if  we cannot speak about God at this we can  make God present in our daily lives in  the way we reach out to others and so  for this will happen of course we cannot  be the presence of God we cannot be the  visitation of God to others unless we  are connected with the Lord so in this  sense the Eucharist is important because  if we do not draw strength from the law  we cannot become his presence receiving  the Eucharist makers United with Jesus  receiving the Eucharist help us to be  transformed into the Eucharist for  others that we to ourselves becomes  bread broken for others so let us draw  strength from God so that we too can become his living presence among men
