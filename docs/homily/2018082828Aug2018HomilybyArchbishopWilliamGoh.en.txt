 it is important for us as Christine that

 we keep the traditions of the faith and

 these traditions that we are Corky is

 not just a written tradition that is not

 just the scripture but also the oral

 tradition by word of mouth it's

 important to understand the word sacred

 tradition a capital T and singular

 sacred tradition refers to the whole

 content of the gospel the gospel is

 Jesus Christ the whole gospel therefore

 is to transmit the person called Jesus

 the Christ that is sacred tradition

 that's the first principle second

 principle is we have to distinguish

 between sacred tradition capital T will

 tradition small T and s flora sacred

 tradition until you refers to the

 content of the gospel tell Jesus Christ

 and so with the content therefore refers

 to all those essential doctrines of the

 church they are fundamental truth cannot

 be changed then we have the sacred

 traditions small T&amp;S traditions and the

 way we express our faith traditions that

 we lift our faith traditions would

 differ from culture to culture they are

 means to express our field depending on

 your culture we need to express our

 faith in concrete ways it is inevitable

 and unless the faith become so abstract

 so whatever we do whatever traditions we

 have small traditions they must express

 our love for the be tradition the

 tradition is about Jesus
