Is your faith alive or is your faith dead? Your faith is alive if you find your faith life vibrant, full of energy,
full of life, full of love. Your faith is dead when the faith you have is but simply a burden in your life, trying to fulfill some obligations, some religious duties and to obey some commandments. If you don't experience abundant life in your faith, you have not yet met Jesus.

You can know the faith, you can know the doctrines, you can know many things about Scripture and theology, but if you have not encountered Jesus, you do not know Jesus. If your faith is alive, then this faith must bear fruit in love and persevere in hope. Faith is to know that God loves us. If you don't have experience of being chosen, being loved by God in a very personal way, then that is not good news. There is nothing to rejoice. It's only when you are loved, when you are chosen. It's just like sometimes in life,
people chose you to be his confidant, to be his friend, and you feel honoured, feel loved. So the most important thing about faith, is faith that we are loved by God.
When you read the Word of God, does the Word of God jump out at you? When you read the Word of God, do you feel that God is speaking to you in a very personal way? If you know Jesus, every word you read, you can feel as if the Lord is speaking to you in a personal way. So faith is not something abstract. You know you have faith in God,

you know you are loved by God, when you are a man of charity. You know, in life, if you truly love, you will never give up hope.

Sometimes there are difficult people in our lives. The reason why we give up hope on them is because we lack the capacity to love. When there is love, there is always hope. When there is hope, then we will know that we will grow also in faith because hope can only be sustained by faith. Faith is the one that continues to grow because we know that somehow God will look into our interests in life. And He will be the one who will raise us up.
