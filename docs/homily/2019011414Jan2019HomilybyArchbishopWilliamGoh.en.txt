Many Catholics have misunderstood the great difference between evangelisation and proselytisation. To proselytise is to make converts. Evangelisation is the proclamation of Good News. Evangelisation is the first stage. Proselytisation is the second stage. The Good News is that the kingdom of God is here. The kingdom of God is the reign of God's love and mercy and forgiveness and justice. The kingdom of God simply means to say, God is now ruling the world, not Satan, not sin, not selfishness. If God rules the world, if God rules the heart of every human person, there will be peace, there will be love, joy, harmony, unity. We are all God's children. He loves us all regardless of who we are, rich or poor, sinners or saints.

Jesus is the embodiment of the kingdom of God in person. Jesus manifests the Father's unconditional love and mercy which he himself had experienced. How do you respond if you encounter God's love and mercy? Repent and believe the Good News. To repent means simply to turn to the Lord. When you are attracted to the Good News,

you will turn away from sins.
Evangelisation is to tell that Jesus makes a difference in my life, that Jesus has given meaning and purpose, that Jesus is the one who heals me. Jesus gives me love.
The moment they fall in love with Jesus,

then we begin the process of proselytisation. If you want to bring someone to Jesus, don'alk about doctrines, all those things. Talk about how wonderful Jesus is.
