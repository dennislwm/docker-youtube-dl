 my dear brothers and sisters in Christ

 at the end of the gospel this is what we

 read Jesus said to them do not be afraid

 go and tell my brothers that they must

 leave for Galilee they will see me there

 my dear brothers and sisters it is

 interesting to note that jesus told His

 disciples to meet him at Gallivan why

 did he ask them to meet him at Galilee

 why not in Jerusalem where he rose from

 the dead he could have met them there in

 fact he met the apostles at the Upper

 Room eight days later and then he went

 to Galilee to meet the rest of his

 brothers my dear brothers and sisters

 Jesus not choose to meet his disciples

 at Jerusalem but in Galilee simply

 because Galilee was the place in which

 he began his ministry the place where it

 held four memories for Jesus and

 disciples because it was there that they

 met Jesus it was there that they were

 called by Jesus and therefore Galilee

 brought them to the experiences they had

 with Jesus right from the very beginning

 of his ministry and so to go back to

 Galilee to meet him is what the Lord

 Jesus is asking

 is one of us to do today to go back to

 Galilee is to go back to your original

 experience of the risen Christ my dear

 brothers and sisters have you met the

 risen Christ have you seen him have you

 encountered him

 have you experienced England if you

 recall my dear brothers and sisters that

 day when you were baptized of course

 most of you were babies

 you were sleeping or crying but at least

 you remembered that they will receive

 First Holy Communion I'm sure on the day

 when you receive First Holy Communion

 when you encountered Jesus it was a

 great day or the day when you were

 confirmed to be a witness of Jesus it

 was another memorable experience and for

 those who were adults when you are

 baptized remember that day you look

 forward to the day of baptism where you

 sacrifice so much just to get that time

 sometimes against the wishes of your

 family members but you paid the price to

 become a Catholic so to return to

 Galilee simply is to remember how you

 have encountered the Lord among your

 brothers and sisters are these memories

 still fresh in your mind it is you

 burning in your heart that is a question

 or have some of you gone demented ready

 and lost this man

 ask yourself where you once stood and

 where you are today what is the

 temperature of your spiritual life I

 used to burning with zero burning we've

 loved or have you lost the passion for

 Jesus we read in today's Gospel how the

 women of Jerusalem how they loved Jesus

 they stood by him at the cross and to

 death and how early in the morning

 and the first day he went to the tomb to

 look for Jesus help me remember him when

 she found that the body was missing and

 how she claimed cling to Jesus my dear

 brothers and sisters how the Apostles

 when they heard the tomb was empty they

 reigned to look for Jesus a kind of

 passion the kind of love for Jesus that

 was what drew them on right from the

 start and to the end my dear brothers

 and sisters what is your love for Jesus

 today is it the same kind of love you

 have for your spouse half dead half a

 life still still your relationship with

 Jesus is the warm sometimes cold

 you don't feel Jesus as many more just

 as you don't feel your spouse love what

 has happened to that fire when you began

 your job you were so excited you were so

 passionate you were so great

 that God has given you his job this

 career his vocation and now I use you

 excited are you still passionate those

 of you who have involve interest

 ministries after baptism you say I want

 to give my life to Jesus I want do

 something are you serving him still with

 that richness of love that zeal or has

 it become a routine it's become a duty

 so the Lecter is it reading is just

 reading it's my duty no the why you can

 sing because it's my duty to sing the

 community is here we just have to

 distribute the host it's not very

 difficult my dear brothers and sisters

 what happens to that loved and you say

 you have encountered the reason God then

 again we are to the Apostles they went

 out they cannot stop talking about Jesus

 because his encounter was such an

 awesome experience it will keep that

 experience in themselves they wanted to

 announce the whole world even when they

 were persecuted even when you brought

 before the Sanhedrin they were ever

 ready you displayed Jesus as Lord they were cowards in the upper room but

 after the resurrection no more they were

 full of hope full of courage and ask you

 have you announced Jesus to people yet

 have you share Jesus with anyone do you

 really believe that Jesus can make a

 difference in your life or has he make a

 difference in our life in the first

  place if he has not that I think I've not

 encountered the risen Lord is the

 religion that you are following

 it is not a lot there is a bit failed

 they cannot save you it on him it's no

 burden to your life and see if it don't

 have enough burdens you have plenty

 every day between Jesus is talking to

 keep you and slaved you better than you

 the set you free to make you happy make

 it more fulfilling life that is why if

 you have nothing to share to others if

 you have no zeal no excitement to talk

 to others about Jesus to give them Jesus

 it means you have not found him he is

 not real my dear brothers and sisters in

 this today the scripture readings the

 liturgy precisely helps us to recall

 that resurrection experience which we

 all have really you notice the whole

 liturgy under scripture readings

 the team is light darkness the team is

 freedom slavery the theme is death

 life these are the basic themes of the

 Easter liturgy dramatized by all these

 ceremonies the scripture reading which

 we read from eggs orders spoke of the

 Israelites being freed from the slavery

 of the Egyptians that slavery reminds us

 of on slavery what is then sleeping you

 mind your brothers and sisters have you

 asked what is it that you're not happy

 about why is the life so miserable what

 is causing you to be and

 leaved who asleep you you enslave

 yourself nobody sent sleeping you don't

 think that people can control you my

 dear brothers and sisters one can

 control you no one can you sleep you you

 can be a prisoner locked in prison got

 in the cell and yet you're the freest

 man on the subject freedom has nothing

 to do with physical freedom it is the

 spiritual freedom the freedom of the

 heart the freedom to love the freedom to

 determine your life the freedom to

 remain tranquil happy joyful what takes

 away your freedom is your sink one

 nature's bondage to pry anger

 unforgiveness hatred jealousy and greed these are the things that makes you

 unhappy really any one of you if you

 tell me that your sins are making you

 happy let me know I want to find out anyone who lives in sin is a slave that

 is the reason why today when we

 celebrate Easter Jesus we are told is

 dyed to our sins he has died to death

 death has no more power over him and

 because of that we knew we are forgiven

 if you have made the sacrament of

 reconciliation during this holy week you

 will understand what I mean

 and so for those of you who have not

 celebrated the sacrament of

 reconciliation you have not made your

 peace with God you continue to bear

 guilt that's why we can be separating Easter

 tonight we are not set free because you

 continue to hold your guilt you can't

 forgive yourself

 you can't forgive others you can't

 forgive God that is why you're miserable

 only the person who can set himself free

 from sins then the reading from prophet

 Ezekiel tells us God wants to give new

 spirit a new heart to the Israelites in

 example they would dry bones my dear

 brothers and sisters you know Jesus has

 come to give us new life in the death of

 Jesus we have come to realize these that

 because this one man who has died for us

 all as st.</c> Paul says it means to say now

 we are whole to die first you some of

 you are always asking me such a simple

 question and you keep costing me further

 hope to be happier how to be happy it's

 so simple to be happy just believe for

 others that's all to give your life

 others to serve others to care for

 others to look after others to love

 others happiness is yours when you start

 leaving for others when you start

 putting others as first in your life

 because they are God's people you'll be

 set free from yourself your miseries

 because you think too much about

 yourself you're always thinking about my

 needs my pleasures my security that's

 why you're not free if you want to be

 free leave for purposed

 the purpose cannot be you the purpose is

 to give life to others transform lives

 if hope to let's make those people when

 they live for others they live with hope

 because there is the future there is the

 future ther is a tomorrow those who live

 for themselves have no tomorrow no

 future so my dear brothers and sisters

 indeed this evening we rejoice in order

 exerted I ask Monsignor now to sing it

 very well we work very hard you notice

 that in this exalted is a very beautiful

 Proclamation when we are told there are

 four lights four lights one of these

 four I first learned when you are

 delivered from slavery in Egypt the

 second night when you the pillar of fire

 vanished the darkness of sin the third

 night when Christians are set free from

 vices and the fourth night we are told

 Christ wrote the prison bars of death

 and rose victorious from the underworld

 these four nights gave us hope that the

 ultimate victory is life over death

 loved over hatred and that is reason why

 my dear brothers and sisters

 st. Augustine reflected a wonder of your

 humble care for us o love of travel T

 beyond all telling do ransom us baby

 gave away your son that is how great the

 love of God is we are slaves and to

 ransom a slave

 God gave away his son and sin Augustin

 exclaim oh truly necessary seen the

 enemy destroyed completely by the death

 of Christ all happy thought that earn so

 great so glorious Redeemer oh happy

 thought which means to say without the

 sin of Adam the sin of Adam was great

 cause all men to suffer but without that

 see there would be no Redeemer and so no

 Gleason say o blessed thought my dear

 brothers and sisters let me conclude when we reflect on the death and

 resurrection of Christ all our mistakes

 all our parts all our faults all our

 sins now becomes moments of Christ he

 has transformed us from this grace to

 grace in his faith as a new creation and

 that is what the first reading we read

 from book of Genesis we are restored to

 the full dignity of sons and daughters

 of God Alleluia
