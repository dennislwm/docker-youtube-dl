 it is so true that in life very often

 when we do things that are wrong because

 of our pride because of our ego because

 of our greed so we become defensive and

 we react to situations and we think

 these people are making our life

 difficult and it's not true is to help

 you not to cause yourself further and so

 we need to recognize whether real

 enemies and many of our enemies actually

 our friends and our face sometimes argue

 enemies because our friends they only

 tell us things that we like to hear

 those things that we don't like to be

 here they won't tell us you know and

 they give us sometimes the wrong picture

 of what is going on and now real enemies

 actually are your friends because it has

 all those things we do here and that's

 why you find them irritating and of

 course sometimes our enemies tell us

 things we don't like to hear there could

 be some truth in it and sometimes a lot

 of truth even but the question is how do

 we regard them love your enemies pray

 for those who persecute you so our

 attitude towards our enemies must be

 something positive we should not be an

 enemy to anyone we should always be the

 friends the best way to win over enemies

 and jesus said precisely you must be

  perfect yes sir homily Father is perfect

 perfection here is not a moral

 perfection perfection in terms of

 compassion in terms of understanding

 there are different kinds of enemies

 some of our enemies are hurt they are

 deeply wounded and so they are reacting

 the nasty they unreasonable and these

 are the enemies that we are called to

 him to reach out to them and to learn to

 identify your pain instead of judging

 them instead of condemning them we try

 to be with them in your in all of us

 have our pain and all our brokenness we

 need to really ask for the grace to love

 our enemies and those so-called enemies

 perhaps it may not be enemies that is

 the other thing

 we need to descend who are the real ones

 you have done something wrong the Lord

 forgives you but sometimes the

 consequences of your sin will pass down

 to the second and the third generation

 so that's why you know whatever we do

 that always remember it's not just for

 the moment is for the things generation

 let us realize that and whatever we do

 there are consequences not just now but

 more the future and the long-term

 consequences cannot be seen until many

 years down the road and history is going

 to repeat so let us pray that we humble

 enough to be like the Lord to loving all

 whether honest or dishonest spinner

 light that is pray that we will our

 enemies over as friends by loving and

 forgiving them
