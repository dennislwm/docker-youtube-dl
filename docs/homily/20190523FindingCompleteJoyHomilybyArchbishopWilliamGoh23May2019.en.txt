 the Lord said I have told you these so

 that my own joy may be in you and your

 joy we complete joy is a very essential

 dimensioned of human life no one can

 live his life without joy without joy

 this life is meaningless is empty and so

 every human person seeks for joy as

 therefore joy is something that the Lord

 wants to give to each one of us every

 Christian therefore is entitled to this

 joy and not only to the joy that the law

 was give to us but that this joy be

 complete so this morning we want to

 reflect what are the enemies of joy

 what is it the brothers of our joy

 because joy is a gift given to us by God

 you know there are some people who

 indulge in perverted joy in the sense

 that they like to dwell on pessimistic

 negative events in their life they like

 to whine they like the demand always

 grumbling even in a bright Sun they say

 so hot rain they say is so dark and so

 wet so you can never please these people

 hot or cold they will complain and that

 is a true so these people they have no

 joy when they see others happy they are

 not so happy also when they are said

 they make sure everybody is set so they

 make life difficult for everyone and

 it's impossible to make them happy

 because they just want to think of life

 in a very negative way and so it's very

 important that

 joy is taken away because we are the

 ones who indulge in perverted joy that

 is why you know there are some people

 who are depressed they always thinking

 of the things that happen in the past

 and they can never get out of it and we

 would think that we should get out of it

 but actually is a kind of perverted joy

 they think that by wallowing in

 self-pity they can find joy and people

 will pity them and they would get

 attention that they want and is very

 important the greatest temptation of the

 devil actually in fact if you were to

 ask me what is the real obstacle to

 meaning in life to live a fullness of

 life it is when the devil dropped us of

 our joy this why st.</c> Francis is very

  clear Saint Francis will mindlessly know and

 to his disciples when we are with each

 other no one must put on a long face

 everybody must be joyful we don't allow

 his disciples to express his no sadness

 she the only time you can express

 sadness before the Lord can the manikin

 whine no problem but not with us because

 we first when we are said when we are

 depressed we will bring others down and

 the devil was with use of our depression

 to make us give up on ourselves to give

 up on others and ultimately give up on

 the world give up on God and then all

 the temptations were coming then the

 devil would tempt us to do things that

 are evil and even suicide ultimately to

  this by ourselves so the greatest weapon of

 the devil is actually sadist he once

 that he was a plant sadness into our

 hearts because when the person is sad

 the person is crippled and it's so

 important because if the devil uses this

 weapon of sadness

 you know why he is the saddest person he

 has no joy

 he has no joy his heart and because the

 devil has no joy he wants to make sure

 that all of us are without joy so if we

 want to turn the devil we want to make a

 devil angry with you you keep on smiling

 he hated mmm he wants us to feel

 miserable and you keep on spanic we come

 together and that is what happens

 especially when people laugh you are

 people are to make yourself and you keep

 on smiling Mladic is more angry so that

 is how we turn the devil and the devil

 don't like us to be happy because he's

 not happy unhappy people make sure that

 we are happy and we tell the devil we

 are happy and that is white we know Pope

 Francis makes it clear in his first

 encyclical the gospel is the gospel of

 joy without joy we cannot attract people

 to live the life of Jesus so it is joy

 and we are taught to be evangelizes of

 joinha so that when people look at us

 they are attracted to believers we don't

 want to draw a company every day

 lamenting every day attending a funeral

 services what Pope Francis's empathy the

 Catholics all look like attending

 funeral service every day there is no

 joy who wants to draw a company without

 joy when there's a joyful company they

 automatically attracted to it and what is the basis of joy the truth is

 joy comes from God and joy does not

 comes from within us it first comes from

 God and then it flows our practice

 that's why Jesus gave us the way to join

 what is the way to John he says as the

 father has loved me so I have loved you

 remain in my love

 the basis for joy kristenjohn is to know

 that we are loved by God we are loved by

 God unconditionally that is the

 foundation of joy so that we don't have

 to be worried even when they are trounce

 even when there are problems even when

 we face difficulties in life even we

 face temptation even when we sinned

 the father has always loved us and he

 can be social even when we see we are

 sorry but we also filled with joy

 because we know that God was always only

 first as the father has loved me I have

 loved you too a Christian would never

 hesitate or would never think that God

 does not love him anymore even he can be

 the greatest sinners God will love the

 person let's the first mrs.</c> so the basis

 of joy is to know that we are loved we

 accepted unconditionally

 then jesus said remain in my love if you

 keep my Commandments you will remain in

 my love Jesus I kept my father's

 Commandments and remain in his love he

 has been clear it is not that keeping

 his Commandments only then God loves it

 there is nobody this mean Jesus but

 Jesus means if you keep my Commandments

 you can remain in my

 in other words the commandments are not

 just mere external observance of rules

 the commandments are recognized on how

 we can love God how we can love one

 another so if you follow these

 Commandments then of course you remain

 in that love if you break the

 commandments it's not to say that God

 does not love you but you have separated

 yourself from the love of God so that is

 the problem so he start to say therefore

 you just keep the commandments and you

 are saved that is not true Islam that is

 rightfully the first reading and since

 Peter makes it clear that the Gentiles

 were converted because God makes no

 distinction between them and us since he

 purify our hearts by faith he gave them

 the Holy Spirit is love even when they

 did not observe the loss of the Jews so

 it is purely the love of God and that is

 why he said you approve of God's anger

 now if you impose on the disciples a

 very burden that neither we nor

 ancestors were strong enough to support

 so keeping the commandments means to

 keep the only commandment commandment of

 love that is the reason why you know in

 the one of the songs that we sing before

 Easter you know the tryam the joy of

 Easter is only taken away when we see so

 when we see joy is taken away when we

 see sadness comes into our life when we

 seen division is in our hearts when we

 sin we become angry become bitter become

 resentful become vindictive when we seen

 before into depression

 we begin to hate ourselves we begin to

 hit and so God does not take away our

 joy it is seen that takes away that joy

 so if we don't want we do one your joy

 to be taken away then we cling to God so

 even when we seen as I've said we go

 back to Jesus but Jesus gives us that

 joy so if you want to keep the Easter

 joy then the only motivation I thank you

 I don't tell people don't see no no no

 no no no people will stop sinning if

 them don't sin because it makes it so

  attractive don't sin mum is very good luck because

 most people tell us don't do things

 because it's so good do you want to hide

 the secret from us no no no what we

 don't tell people don't say we tell

 people be joyful but if you want to be

 joyful then don't a lot seen to take

 away the joy Amos
