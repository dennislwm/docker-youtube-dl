One of the most important doctrines of Christianity is the doctrine of Incarnation. That this God has assumed our humanity. That He is one with us and one like us in all things but sin. I think the greatness of this truth is that because of the Incarnation, we know that this God is really a compassionate God.

Because if God has assumed our humanity, He knows what it means to be a human being.

He knows what it is to go through temptations because Jesus too was tempted. He knows what it means to trayed, to be humiliated, to suffer hunger,

to be rejected. We should never doubt even in our failures , even in our sinfulness. No matter what we do, we know that we can turn to Jesus, the Throne of Mercy because He is the one who will never judge us. We know our sins are always forgiven and Jesus is the one who really can understand all our struggles. And because of His resurrection, we are certain that there will be no death for us. That even at the end of this life, we are sure to be raised from the dead like Jesus, sharing in the fullness of life.
What is required, therefore, is the obedience of faith. If you know that Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the Life,

we surrender to Jesus. Even if you don't understand, it doesn't matter. You just accept. So if you believe that Jesus is the Son of God, He is truly the Son of Man, then the result is obedience. If you believe Jesus is the Son of God, then you have to accept everything the Bible says, even though you don't agree. That is obedience of faith.
