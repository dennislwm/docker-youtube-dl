For those of us who are limping in life, those who are crippled by our past, those of us who are blinded because we are looking at life at a different perspective, as a wrong perspective, then Jesus is there to enlighten us, to open our eyes and to heal us. If you want to find healing grace, we come to the Lord. And precisely in giving Himself entirely to us, He gives us fullness of life. We are asked to welcome Jesus into our lives through reflection of the Word of God. And this is why Advent is a time for us to reflect, for us to sit back and to think through our lives.
It is a good time for us to really spend some quiet time with the Lord. Time to pray, time to reflect and time to really meditate on the Word of God. After that, you can prepare yourself for the Sacrament of Reconciliation.

Then you will find that Christmas becomes a real celebration. Otherwise it's just going to be another activity. It's just going to be another social festival. It's just going to be a lot of excitement and fun, merry making,
but all these things will pass. What we are longing most in our hearts, and I believe that is what we all long for, is peace. We need to see how our lives are integrated.
Is your life an integrated life in whatever you are doing? All these things you have to go through and ask yourself, do they make sense for you? Are you living that purposeful life? If not, there can be no peace. And on our part, in order to find peace, we also can become channels of peace. Most of us actually,

we all need a lot of encouragement and appreciation,
to know that someone is thinking of you, someone is praying for you, someone is loving you.
Let us continue to give hope to one another.
