 my dear brothers and sisters in the

 first reading we have the story of king

 ahab's he was a greedy man he wanted

 more land for himself

 and he wanted a house of nevada and

 because nabo refused to let him have his

 land a heart was unhappy

 he threw tantrums and he could not eat

 could not sleep well just like many a

 big babies we have in our families and

 we are told that because of this his

 wife jezebel began to be worried for him

 he knows as well if you look at her she

 is portrayed as a very wicked cunning

 manipulative lady but actually if you

 read deeper what was the greatest sin of

 the spell what do you think because she

 loved her husband too much that's the

 problem she was obsessed and she put her

 husband above everything she wanted to

 support her husband is that the right

 thing that is my question you know we

 have a lot of small babies and big

 babies in our families small babies are

 your children they are lazy and want to

 study mommy see them all

 good thing let mommy do the homework for

 you you can sleep early and we see your

 poor darling you see your darling only

 300 meters know that he will fish you

 there I will bring you with the guy you

 know 300 meters over because by the time

 you get they might faint you know well

 son ought to walk 300 meters and if your

 big baby happens to be your husband you

 know men they love to eat you know and

 some of them are overweight and you

 women you because I near my hubby love

 steak more for him don't worry darling

 just eat just don't worry I just but you

 tell all the priests there's so many of

 us breathing or having heart attack and

 Eunice at the age of 50 really they're

 having all kinds of illnesses and you

 think what is so they must be starving

 yeah I'm actually very starving yeah and

 you do all these things in the name of

 loved but my question is is this really

 loved why do you do all these things

 like Jezebel because behind is is that

 you love yourself more than you

 loved your loved ones it's because you

 cannot see your loved one suffer it's

 because you cannot see your loved ones

 having to go through the pain of

 purification the pains of discipline the

 pain of growing up and at the end of it

 is because you can't bear to see them

 crying see them suffering because it

 breaks your heart so that your heart

 will not be broken you give them what

 they won so for me the question is also

 do we therefore right or wrong with

 another wrong do we overcome evil with

 another evil precisely into this gospel

 Jesus is very clear don't mistreat Jesus

 in the gospel text today because Jesus

 says you have learned how it was said I

 for eye tooth for tooth but I say to you

 all for the wicked men no resistance in

 adverse the underlying principle of love

 is this don't do don't cause harm to

 Palast if you are causing more harm to

 others then indeed you are not loving

 them and that is why Jesus into this

 gospel yes if your enemies you know what

 we have attacked you you see don't offer

 existence don't fight back why because

 you will help them to come to their

 senses at the end day it is innocent

 suffering that will

 justify your love and your compassion

 and so today let us pray that we will be

 strong in doubt that will be true in

 love and it is not easy let me tell you

 it is not easy to really really love

 it's very difficult for the bishop as

 well I got a very soft heart no but

 sometimes what to do we have to be firm

 not because we don't want to love these

 people because I will cause more harm

 and so I ask God to give you the grace

 to do the right thing and to explain to

 those people who are big babies in your

 life but I mean no mummy love to you but

 you know Abby I love you very much but

 then you see you know the dead you get

 heart attack you have to stay so because

 of that I need to control your diet but

 now and then you can always eat them a

 good Makana once a week once a week amen
