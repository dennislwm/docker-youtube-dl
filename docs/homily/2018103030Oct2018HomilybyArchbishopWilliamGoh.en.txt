We have to understand what leadership requires of us. A leader is always thinking in terms of the welfare of those people under his or her charge. Because a leader is really concerned with protecting the members. That is why to be a leader is not easy. A leader is always served last. A leader has to ensure that all the members of the office or the members of the family are all taken care of. A leader does not put himself in the forefront. A good leader is about taking good care of those under his charge, empowering, enriching those under his charge. That is a leader. A leader must be willing even to die. We must be concerned that the members are growing in holiness.
They are being sanctified by the work they do. The work is a means to sanctification.
The work is not end itself. And you are to help them, so that you are preparing them for not this life only. You are called to prepare them for eternal life. God has entrusted you with those people under your charge to help, to be responsible for them so that they too will share the life of God. Actually,

it is an integral thing. Because to help a person to be holy, you don't worry whether the person will do the work or not. If a person wants to grow in holiness, he will do the work very well. Because now he is not answerable to the boss, he is answerable to God. He is not motivated by the boss, he is motivated by God. He is not only motivated by the salary,

he is motivated by the glory that is given to him. So that's why if we have the right focus, the staff will do their work. They will be responsible because they are passionate,

because they are rightly motivated.
