 sympathy I'm sure he was preaching from

 his own personal encounter with the

 recent order and that is why when we

 hear testimonies we are always moved

 like to hear testimonies testimonies but

 these testimonies were not just simply a

 very subjective testimony it was true

 they encountered the reason not but then

 again we need to substantiate their

 personal testimony with some facts and

 once having done the preliminary then we

 not to make an act of commitment so what

 must we do so the first movement of

 faith is really a movement into our

 hearts so when the word of God is

 preached you notice how this is how the

 movement of faith begins when the word

 of God is preached then the first thing

 we do is we start to reflect on

 ourselves when we hear a testimony what

 do we do then begin to ask ourselves

 what about us repentance therefore is to

 remove the obstacles from our hearts

 prevent us from seeing the risen Lord

 and these obstacles are sin of

 unforgiveness of pride especially

 pride when we want to fit Jesus into our

 own mind to enter into ourselves also

 means to say we need to set our own

 griefs our own brokenness and here we

 have Mary Magdalene of course she was

 missing Jesus who died and she was

 heartbroken now the first step is to

 move inside need to feel the pain first

 and that is a very what we call

 important process of reading the field

 cutting to in touch with yourself and

 the second stage once you get in touch

 with yourself

 then we must move from inward to outward

 so when we have encountered the Lord

 then we move out

 moving out to proclaim the good news and

 that is the whole cycle of the movement

 of faith and so if you have not reached

 the last cycle that means to say your

 faith in the resurrection is still not

 complete until you moved up and as you

 moved up and tell people about Jesus

 then you begin to reinforce your faith

 the only way to evangelize yourself is

 to evangelize others that is the only

 way do you need way to keep your faith

 is to shed if you don't share what you

 have you will do see in every area of

 life we need to make use of what the

 Lord has given to rest so that we can

 retain them
