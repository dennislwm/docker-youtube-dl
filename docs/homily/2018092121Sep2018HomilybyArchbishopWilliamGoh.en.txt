Every one of us, we have a different vocation. Every vocation is unique. Every vocation is a calling from God. And God has given us all precisely different talents, different temperaments in order to help each other to be like Jesus himself. So it's important for us to really discover our vocation and to treasure our vocation and not to try to imitate others. Whether you are a worker,

whether you are a professional or whether you are a homemaker, that is also a vocation.

Even if you are sick, it's a vocation actually. If you are sick and you are cheerful and you are grateful and you are not grumpy and you are always praising God and seeing positive things about your own illness as a sign for your motification and your humility as well to be nursed by others.

There are certain patients when we serve them we feel inspired,

we feel edified, we want to help them even more because they are so grateful they're so thankful and the caregiver actually is being helped by those who are sick. It doesn't matter what calling you have in life. What is important is to use our calling to praise God, to glorify Him and to lead others to know Him through the service that we give through our very being, through our very presence.

That's why every vocation is a call to holiness. What is important is that whatever we do, let e our vocation to sanctify us. We need to grow in holiness through the vocation that the Lord has given to you.

Jesus called St Matthew. Why? He called him to make him an apostle to tax collectors.

He converted one tax collector to bring other tax collectors. And so it's important therefore for you in your vocation, how to inspire others to share in your vocation. And so it's very important to ask how do you use your vocation to really glorify God. So we pray to the Lord that we might be like St Matthew to witness and bring people to Jesus.
