 my dear brothers and sisters in Christ we celebrate the solemnity

we celebrate the solemnity inception indeed a very appropriate day

 to celebrate the opening of the year of

 mercy because the celebration of the

 solemnity of the meta conception is

 truly a celebration of divine mercy the

 God chose Mary as the new Eve to begin a

 new humanity a humanity that is broken

 that is wounded the face of thematic

 reception is not primarily to clarifying

 memory brother it is to glorify the work

 of God in and through her Mary did not

 deserve to be conceived immaculately and

 was not by her merits it was purely as

 the gospel tells us by the grace and

 mercy of God but is why at every

 celebration in honor of Mary the real

 honor that we give is really to God and

 has made this possible it is within this

 context that we can situate this year of

 Mercy because what Mary received being

 freed from sin at the very beginning of

 a conception is what God has meant for

 all of us right from the start

 into the second reading from that of

 simple we are told before the world was

 made he chooses he chooses in Christ to

 be holy and spotless this has always

 been intention of God so that we can

 share in his life

 and share in his loved the owning

 happiness that God desires for you and

 me is that we share in the fullness of

 his life and therefore what has been

 granted to Mary in principle has been

 granted to all of us the warning

 difference is that Mary received this

 gift of divine life and divine love

 freely and we great docility and

 humility she said yes yes to the gift of

 divine life yes to the gift of loved

 what is the real problem in the world

 today the real problem is that most of

 us we don't want to receive the free

 gift of God's love and mercy we want to

 earn it you want it due to how way

 precise into this was reading with the

 story of Adam and Eve they wanted power

 knowledge we know is power this by

 science and technology they are symbols

 of power power to control power to

 manage our lives and many people in the

 world things that power is the way to

 secure happiness and so we can

 understand today people are reading the

 internet getting all kinds of

 information because information means

 power but my dear brothers and sisters

 this is where the world does not want to

 receive the gift of life the gift of

 love from God men refers to loved and

 that is true and they team and they're

 being misled into thinking that power is

 love it is not in fact love is power

 power is not love love is the real power

 and got therefore offers Adam and Eve

 loved and live but they were too proud

 to accept it as a free gift this

 precisely is the sin of Satan and his

 angels because of pride they reject the

 gift of God they want to find their own

 existence without God and this is what

 2nd reason it's all about today what is

 secularism what is humanism we can do it

 our way

 we can build a new paradise we can build

 a kingdom of peace and joy simply with

 economic progress beef science and

 technology this is where men has

 deceived himself science and technology

 economic progress can make this world a

 better place in terms of living in terms

 of material goods but they cannot change

 the heart of man since the beginning of

 time until today man remains a sinner

 right from the start therefore the

 question of original sin which the first

 reading is the referring to is that all

 of us have a bad start humanity have a

 bad start in life the moment we come

 into this world we are broken

 we are wounded because we share the same

 witnesses of Adam and Eve and that is

 the reason why today we repeat the sin

 of Adam and Eve

  pride self-will disappearance and because we

 are deceived by the world the

 consequences of sinned we always known

 is that the Lord allowed us and permits

 us to be punished by our sins once in

 lease to another and that is why the

 story of Genesis speaks about the

 gradual increase in sin beginning with

 Adam and Eve and truly and when a person

 is wounded and hurt and deceived by the

 world it becomes insecure it begins to

 grab that is why the modern man is very

 insecure it's always worried about his

 life and the greatest fear of the modern

 man is what the fear of the AFT because

 that means the end of everything

 and that is why most of you you go for

 make over most of you are 70 years old

 but you look like 50 I'm 58

 I look like 58 because we want to hide

 this reality of death before us and the

 world wants us to pretend that there is

 no they have and that is why the world

 is in this kind of stage fear fear makes

 us greedy and all they are the sins in

 life but I think the worst thing is you

 know when we reflect back on what is

 happening in our life we regret I think

 the greatest you can say punishment of

 sin it's not simply hurting people

 hurting our families hurting our loved

 ones this all happens because we do not

 want the way of loved

 because we want power we want famed when

 we come to realize that the people that

 we love most that our family has broken

 out because we have been focusing on the

 wrong things of life we've been focusing

 on career money fame gambling casino

 addictions and all this destroy family

 life destroy your peace destroy your

 happiness that's why those people would

 cheat you can never be happy in life

 I can see opposite who is irresponsible

 can live in peace with himself you

 cannot your conscience will come to

 prick you and that was what happened in

 the first reading again they sinned and

 what happened

 we are told later on they were naked and

 they hid themselves from God afraid to

 face the truth about themselves

 and that is the whole problem instead of

 recognizing that this is something that

 we need to change in our lives what we

 do we rationalize give me excuses

 and so now Adam says actually I think

 one was he was the one who tempted me

 and you've actually any want to tell my

 husband do you know it was a Satan and

 Satan of course not no one to blame but

  himself so we want to push we want to blame

 people instead of owning our sins and

 like King David said I have sinned

 against the Lord period no excuses

 that's why I say the best way to get rid

 of sin in life name your demon and your

 demon will run away from you if you

 cannot name your diamond your demon will

 continue to have a hole over you in

 and there's a thing that says you know

 speak the truth and shame the devil

 but if you can't admit the truth about

 yourself then there is no change nothing

 will happen it will only condemn

 yourself and the world will also condemn

 to you and I tell you this world is a

 cruel world every time when I read the

 papers I read the papers and I feel

 sorry because the papers would keep

 highlighting the sin that you are

 committed the offense you have committed

 again and again they will remind you

 remember last time this was what you did

 and history will keep on telling you and

 no matter even your life of change

 it was to tell you in the eyes of the

 world you are condemned once a config

 forever convict your was to opera not

 leave me zero once a convict always

 accompanied that's the world the world

 does not forgive you and the world

 cannot forgive you the world wants only

 revenge and they are happy to keep

 reminding you how and what you have done

 in the past there is no forgiveness they

 strike today my dear brothers and

 sisters as we gathered here this is

 where I think is important the Feast of

 the Immaculate Conception is telling us

 there is the new beginning there is a

 new beginning Mary is the beginning of

 this in beginning because Jesus will be

 born from me out of Mary he will be the

 Redeemer he is the new Adam as Mary is

 the new East Jesus true God to men he

 shows us the mercy of God in his life in

 his miracles it is so healing merciful

 in his death and resurrection therefore

 looking at the mercy of God today we

 know that we are loved that's right

 today in the first reading God promised

 that out

 it would not be Satan and his angels and

 see never triumph but grace with Ryan

 this is a very beautiful text and simple

 it said in Romans again where sin

 increases grace abounds all the more we

 must know everything that the world is

 going to rings and that evil is winning

 the ultimately is divine grace that will

 try in life what is your attitude

 towards -</c> what is your attitude towards

 yourself well it's an attitude towards

 your husband who commits adultery your

 wayward children what is your attitude

 do you give up hope on them or do you

 believe that they can change if you are

 men of faith like Mary and nothing is

 impossible for God and so in oh my dear

 brothers and sisters those of you who

 have lived wolken life those of you who

 are seen as those of you have left the

 church those of you who are still

 addicted or enslaved by sin I want to

 tell you today you can be liberated you

 can be healed both of you and there are

 so many of you because every time when

 people thought to be especially the

 older ones are not the only the young

 even the older ones they say father what

 can I do for my grandmother what can I

 do for my grandfather what's gonna do

 for my elderly parents every day they

 are still grumbling about the past you

 know last time I you know what you're

 dead to me

 no last time I suffered so much you know

 how your your death was what we call

 committing adultery etc they keep on

 repeating sometimes you know hear them

 and you say no no this is the most very

 repeating all the time and the more you

 tell them nevermind he's okay he's over

 you'll repeat even more

 know why because they are wounded they

 are hurt they can let go they are still

 living in the past they keep on

 repeating a person keeps on repeating

 means to say the person is still wounded

 and in the ceiling

 he needs to be liberated otherwise

 sometimes I look at this elderly because

 the younger ones you got chance to not

 rependa delivery near to God

 I'd want you to die in pieces this

 imagine you should have your eyes wide

 open unforgiveness in your heart how can

 you die in peace we need to let go but I

 know you cannot let go that I also know

 yeah father I want to forgive my husband

 I want to forgive my channel I cannot of

 course you cannot without the grace of

 God you cannot but with the grace of God

 like Mary today in the gospel how can

 this come about the Holy Spirit will

 overshadow you with the grace of God

 nothing is impossible and that is what

 the angel said and Mary said I'm the

 handmaid of the Lord that whatever said

 be done to me somebody brothers and

 sisters as we begin the year of mercy I

 want you all to be messengers of God

 mercy give hope to people merciful name

 merciful be compassionate because we

 ourselves are sinners the pressure is a

 sinner -</c> if I am compassionate it's only

 because I acknowledge my own sinfulness

 my own struggles to be a good priests to

 be a faithful priest and once you begin

 that acknowledgment and say yes I have

 sinned against the Lord thank the Lord

 will give you the grace to overcome and

 once you encounter the loss of even

 grace you become a channel of cosmic sea

 and this is what I want you to do

 and deciding this year of mercy you have

 the graces and just now we said don't go

 through the holy door not just go

 through the door under introduction very

 important everybody can go through the

 door makes no difference you can go

 through ten times to difference it's not

 going through the door it's a walking

 the dorm is a dog Jesus I want now to

 walk the way of Jesus and the handmaid

 of the Lord and the servant of the Lord

 is to say from now on Jesus is my dog

 Jesus is my shepherd I want to walk the

 way of truth the way of love the way of

  life at the way this Jubilee year would be a

 waste of time to walk through the holy

 door means to say the side that she says

 they are certain what we call conditions

 to receive God's mercy indulgences you

 need to go for the sacrament

 reconciliation because that is where you

 experience God's mercy the Eucharist

 again be encountered the mercy of God in

 giving himself to us mercy and so make

 few use of what the dog is giving you

 and I deal with my dear brothers and

  sisters it's a beautiful year I think that's why

 the things Jubilee year of mercy is much

 more exciting than the previous are the

 celebration because why we all need

 Mesilla and mercy actually makes us

 loving people give us hope and so for

 this year pick your resolution I will be

 the channel of God's mercy aiming
