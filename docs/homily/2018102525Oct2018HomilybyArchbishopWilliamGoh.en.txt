If our lives are living in mediocrity, if we find that we are not living the fullness of life, if there is no passion in what we are doing, then certainly we need to be set on fire. We cannot be fired up unless we remove all those obstacles that prevent us from allowing the light of Christ to shine in and through us. It is important for us, especially when we are under opposition and we feel tired and we feel disappointed, disillusioned that people are against us, and this is where we need to keep our focus. Every time when you are in trouble, every time when you feel sad,
the first thing you must think of is Jesus.

How did Jesus handle these issues? All the challenges, Jesus has gone through. And so we have to allow the Spirit of Christ to live in our hearts through faith. So that is why no one can partake of this mission unless we are alive with Jesus. And that is the whole problem. Many of us Catholics, we are not alive with Jesus. We never read the Gospel,

we never pray. The thinking that we have,
the thoughts we have, they are worldly values,

they are not rooted in the Gospel. That is why we lack fire. So this is where Jesus is our great mentor. And so when we think of His love, of His passion, and most of all His resurrection, then we know there is nothing the Lord cannot do. If you have contemplated the resurrection, then nothing is impossible for God.
