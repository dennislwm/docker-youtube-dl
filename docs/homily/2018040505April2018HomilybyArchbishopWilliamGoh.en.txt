 what is important for us is to realize

 that miracles certainly are important in

 the mission of the church the church

 needs miracles of healing

 especially to testify to the power of

 the risen Lord that God is still alive

 that Jesus is truly risen in our myths

 it it is important that miracles they

 only have a certain role to play in our

 faith if you are just focus on miracles

 and apparitions alone it simply means

 that you lack faith if you have faith a

 one miracle is enough to transform your

 whole life

 a simple where he encountered the Lord

 that changed his whole life Jesus does

 not perform miracles in order to create

 sense of wonders miracles important

 insofar as the pointers to God himself

 we notice the same Peter quickly direct

 the people to Christ it is Jesus the one

 that you crucified that has risked him

 that has restore him to health he was

 not focused on himself our miracles that

 you have encountered deepen your faith

 in the Lord that is the most important a

 deepening of faith of course would mean

 a change of life the repentance is

 therefore necessary so at the end of the

 day in America's are an invitation for

 us to have a greater faith in Jesus we

 have a greater faith in Jesus then we

 will live the life that Jesus lives so

 we pray as we celebrate this mass there

 to know our faith will increased

 especially when we encounter Lord in our

 daily life our focus is always an

 increase of faith in the Lord the more

 religious experiences you have the more

 you your faith is deeper and we faith in

 Jesus then everything is possible by

 faith in Jesus we can carry our process

 cheerfully we faith in Jesus we know we

 will triumph over

 everything even when we suffer and then

 that is how we live a resurrected life a

 resurrected life means to say we are

 always at peace in good times in bad

 times in sorrows in trials in the happy

 moments this is where truly the risen

 Lord is with us and so conversion is

 what is demanded of essa simple st.</c>


Peter says now you must repent and turn

 to God a minute
