 so we are in the sixth week of Easter

 how time flies history is already coming

 to an end

 and this Thursday begin the Sabbath

 Feast of the Ascension therefore the

 Liturgy of the church pre passes for the

 Feast of the Ascension when Jesus will

 depart from us as he returns to his

 Heavenly Father and Jesus said to his

 disciples now I'm going to the one who

 sent me not one of you at health has

 asked where are you going you are set at

 heart because I have told you least every departure is always painful even

 someone that you don't like very much

 even to bring some paint and especially

 the partials of your loved ones I'm sure

 some of you during your quite moments

 would have thought what will happen when

 one of your parents pass away your

 elderly parent or your spouse and so the

 thought of them leaving us with causes

 to be said like 'hey--</c> of horses so we

 can understand why the Apostles was set

 at heart because they have grown to be

 attached to Jesus every departure always

 cost a new situation that is why Jesus

 in the gospel said still I must tell you

 the truth it is for your own good that I

 am going we can accept the artists

 warning when we see that the departure

  ultimately is for our good and every partial actually is also an

 arrival the one who departs were arrived

 and those people who are left behind

 will have a new life as well that is why

 Jesus said unless I go he a wicked will

 not come to you can we accept the

 changes in life especially the departure

 of our loved ones with that perspective

 actually in Singapore we are more

 fortunate if you if you were still in

 Malaysia or new Europe on the state's motherhood that's not last very long and

 most lenient if you ever be for child at

 all in developed societies poor parents

 are working and when that time the child

 is 18 years old the child would have

 graduated and move something else I have

 known many young people Australia

 America the moment they go to the

 University test the end they hardly come

 back and the moment I graduate they look

 for their own house to stay they will

 stay their parents anymore and so

 they'll go off station to find work so

 the period when parents are with their

 children actually it's a very short

 window an only short window but also at

 the same time if they are working that

 time is very limited but truly I mean if

 we want to grow then the patcher is

 necessary so sometimes the departure for

 loved ones caused us to move to another

 state of life there is always the change

 whenever someone lives it forces

 and instead is the reason why if we are

 not fearful of changed then we will

 accept departures with a greater

 openness and happiness and so Jesus

 taught the disciples if I do not go the

 Holy Spirit cannot come to you and the

 Holy Spirit that will change lives

 so for Jesus his departure actually is

 in order that he can come again in a new

 way so in truth Jesus never leaves us he

 lives to be presently first in another

 way and so he comes to us in the gospel

 today in the Holy Spirit and we know

 through hindsight that indeed the Holy

 Spirit who comes into the world

 first and foremost sure that what Jesus

 teach was true and therefore he reviews

 about our sin is the wooden one who can

 convince us in our hearts what is right

 what is wrong at the same time we proof

 who was in the right that is he

 justified Christ by his death and

 resurrection and we know that he is

 truly the son of the father so this

 afternoon as we serve with this must let

 us pray for this openness this

 receptivity to the new ways the new

 opportunities that the Lord is giving to

 each one of us if we are ready to be

 receptive in the first reading precisely

 we show how we read how poor insiders in

 spite of the fact they were in prison

 they were singing God's praises which is

 unimaginable that this mental thing they

 put in prison and they were praising and

 singing and saying hallelujah these

 people certainly must have been sold

 directed by the Holy Spirit after

 conviction that Jesus is thought or else

 I don't think you in the prison we can

 even be full of anger and resentment but

 they are full of praises so much so that

 the doors were even flung open because

 of their faith and confidence in the

 door and brought about the conversion of

 the jailer so as we continue to pray and

 to prepare ourselves for a piece of

 sanction that is asked Lord to help us

 to continue to be open and must fall

 open to the ways that God was super in

 our lives
