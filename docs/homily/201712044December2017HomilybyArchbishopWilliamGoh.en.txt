 promoting unity today is much more

 challenging task than our forefathers

 how can we bring unity unity presumes

 that we all share certain values the

 scripture reading propose that there can

 be will is only in people turn to God

 and this is where the question of time

 on the question of collaboration is

 important that is the reason why also

 the church always encourage interview

 style so that in beginning to share with

 each other then we begin to realize that

 we have a lot of common ground basic

 truth into this hospital you know this

 Jesus was not an exclusivist

 Jesus welcomed the century and the

 century himself sacristy example as well

 being open being available to the grace

 of God and Jesus warning that when we

 begin to exclude people we exclude

 ourselves also and so it is very

 important and this morning as we reflect

 on the tip of Christmas hope for unity

 the world we pray also for generosity

 and to recognize that we must take

 people where they are that is the

 beginning of it this is how the journey

 with them and hopefully for those people

 who have that encounter with a lot Jesus

 they will come to know Jesus as a savior

 otherwise through their own level of

 faith to their own sincerity they too

 will experience the peace and the joy

 the Lord wants to give them
