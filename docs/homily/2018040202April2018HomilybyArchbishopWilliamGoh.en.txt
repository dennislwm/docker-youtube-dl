 fail in the resurrection of Christ is

 the foundation of Christian faith all

 that we believe about Jesus all that we

 believe in the scriptures regarding him

 is based on the fact that Jesus he was

 crucified he died and he rose to so

 resurrection therefore means a

 transfigured body a new body it has to

 do be some earthly body and they say

 when Jesus was raised from the dead

 many could not recognize him without

  fail you cannot recognize the reason Lord he

 was so transformed that he could walk

 through doors and so on so the

 resurrected body is different from a

 resuscitated body and the fact that the

 gospel was preached in the first 40

 years without the mention of the empty

 tomb by simple it means to say the empty

 tomb stories were not absolutely

 necessary for failure simple preach the

 gospel without mentioning the empty tomb

 story still the empty tomb story is

 important as an illustration for those

 of us who need to show that Jesus is

 truly alive so that the body was not

 there is an indication not a proof an

 indication that Jesus was truly recent

 and therefore for us all if we want to

 deepen our faith in the resurrection

 then this is what we need to do we are

 told a st.</c> Peter of the encountering

 Jesus began to reflect on his death

 trying to understand the scoop

 and these people who even when st.</c> Peter

 went to the tomb we are too he saw the

 empty tomb and he was speechless he

 didn't want to make sense of it it was

 later on that he came to understand so

 fill in the resurrected Lord requires

 time for us to processed as we grew in

 faith the deeper the encounter with the

 risen Lord but what we need to do

 therefore is to pray for deeper faith a

 deeper receptivity to our encounters of

 the risen Lord which can happen to us

 every day when you attend Mass when you

 greater Scriptures are just in your

 quiet moments and you will encounter the

 risen Lord
