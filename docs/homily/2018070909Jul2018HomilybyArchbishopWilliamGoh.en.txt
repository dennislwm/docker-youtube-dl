 sometimes when we're going through

 sufferings in life sometimes we suffer

 the consequences of our sins don't take

 it as if it is God punishing rest in

 fact it's just like parents you know

 when you punish your own children you

 are punishing yourself when you do it it

 is out of love up of compassion and this

 was what the Lord did for the people of

 Israel so that they could reflect what

 they were doing and so that once again

 they will return to Him and be betrothed

 to him in intimacy in love this is the

 compassion of God of taking away the

 shame of the Israelites

 giving them new life in the gospel the

 same thing is repeated where we have the

 daughter of wonder officials who died

 and this is true again the second part

 of the gospel where we have the woman

 suffering from a blood disorder from

 hemorrhaged so what is needed what is

 needed for us to receive healing power

 cells all of us we need healing of a

 broken heart wounded heart illnesses and

 most of all from our own sinfulness what

 is needed two things that needed firstly

 we need faith the faith for the court

 official who believed in spite of all

 the skeptics he put his trust in Jesus

 ability to heal he did not hesitate

 he cling to that faith in Jesus singing


- for this woman she spent all her money

 we are -</c> for all the doctors to heal her

 and she knew that Jesus would be the

 last resort

 and besides faith what is also most

 important is the humility the humility

 of the call official to ask the Lord to

 come and heal a daughter this imagine if

 the Lord could not heal her daughter he

 would have been made a fool and again

 the same for this woman and she was

 humble enough to acknowledge when Jesus

 said who touched me and that is why she

 was set free and so my dear brothers and

 sisters the problem with verses we lack

 faith we like faith that God will heal

 erst if you have faith the moment when

 you are sick you pray to the Lord for

 healing not as a last resort as the

 first resort we turn to the Lord for

 healing and secondly we need humility

 there are many of us who are sick

 spiritually sick wounded but we dare not

 ask for healing because we are too proud

 we are too proud to be known as a person

 who needs healing and so many of us we

 need prayers but we don't ask people to

 pray for us because we are afraid that

 people were king lori of us and the

 truth is we all need press humility is

 the gateway to receive the blessings of

 god
