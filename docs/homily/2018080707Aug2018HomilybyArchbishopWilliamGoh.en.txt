 so very often all of us we have many

 situations when we encounter desperation

 because of fear relationship because of

 fear projects or sometimes because we

 face enemies who wants to hunt us and in

 such a situation we certainly feel

 discouraged and totally helpless and and

 so today the scripture readings are very

 encouraging because the Lord said in

 response to her son the Lord shall be

 loves ayan again appeared all his glory

 the Lord will rebuild us the Lord with

 strength eNOS especially when we think

 that life is too difficult and that we

 are totally helpless in the face of such

 desperate situations and so today if we

 feel discouraged and if we feel the what

 we call nervous today the gospel is very

 interesting and very reassuring that so

 sometimes when we think that the Lord is

 not because that the Lord is oblivious

 to our suffering of Libya's work but

 he's aware

 so Jesus he was in the huge brain by

 himself and I think he must have heard

 me a Christ in prayer and then the Lord

 decided to walk towards them and so it

 is good very consoling to know that even

 in our Christ in our miseries we should

 not be afraid that the Lord is with us

 even when we cannot feel his presence

 and there is why he said to us courage

 it is I do not be afraid and it is

 important also reminded for us that we

 cannot do without the Lord in

 our life the reason why many averse when

 we face the storms of life then we

 instead of facing the hit win we become

 hit win ourselves we all cheat how fun

 and we have all kinds of hallucinations

 just like st.</c> Peter no the apostle says

 they were thought they were seeing a

 ghost and this is true when we are under

 pressure when we are frightened we begin

 to imagine things begin to exaggerate

 things we begin to see things that are

 not there because of fear so fear this

 is a person to hello Sydney this is

 where it is important that we bring

 Jesus with us and Jesus said you know

 and when we bring Jesus because what

 must we do again we are toasting ether

 began to sing because he was not

 focusing on the Lord he was focusing on

 his peers and on himself that is what

 the Lord said to Peter men of little

 faith why did you doubt so sometimes

 again in our problems you know instead

 of focusing on the law to gain strength

 from him we are thinking too much of our

 problems we are worrying too much and be

 managing too much so in such moments of

 doubts in such moment of difficulties we

 must keep our eyes on Jesus so that we

 will not sing so that we will not

 hesitate so simple as spotters this

 great lesson not just to put our eyes on

 Jesus and not on ourselves

 again a very important I mentioned of

 healing but we need is to be touched by

 the Lord what we need is to be go closer

 to lot to be touched by him and be

 attached by the Lord we I feel and a lot

 pushes through each other so this is

 very important that as a community we

 must always touch each other because the

 Lord is using us to encourage one

 another to support each other to

 strengthen each other this is where we

 see the hand of Christ continuing to

 heal us today so a person who is the


- from the community would not be able

 to experience a Healing Touch of God and

 God becomes absent so the community here

 is very important because the Lord Jesus

 wants us to touched him and when he

 touched him then they were completely

 cured and so this is where it's

 important question of sharing the

 question of sharing our pain our Joy's

 our sorrows and this is how we are

 healed by the Lord
