 we are blessed in many ways we are

 blessed with many gifts and yet very

 often we take the gifts that the Lord

 has given to us for granted instead of

 using them for the service of the God

 the church in a pediment responder all

 these privileges away

 we don't really appreciate what the Lord

 is even dressed and that is why today

 when we read the letters import the

 Romans it is good to ask ourselves how

 many of us we treasure this gift of

 faith that the Lord has given to us we

 don't have to pay a price while affinity

 for most of us we receive that faith

 from our parents we don't even have to

 search for it perhaps this is the real

 reason because we don't pay a price and

 live with Santino whence a free gift we

 are not interested freak if we take meat

 roll but when you have to really earn

  your then you will treasure what you have

 none of us here can therefore say we do

 not have the means to become a saint

 none of us here can say that we do not

 have the means to know Jesus and to live

 a good Catholic life it is whether we

 make use of the means that the Lord has

 given terrorists and so my dear brothers

 and sisters if we do want to be judged

 as Jesus would have said on the day

 these people were condemned us because

 we have failed to make use of the

 privileges
