 in life we all have our betrayers we

 have our misunderstandings and

 especially those people who have hurt us

  deeply they are always our loved ones it's very

 difficult to forgive especially those

 people we have trusted most

 we have loved most and when the

 disappoint us and when they betrayed us

 it is very difficult to forgive and

 that's the reason why many of us have

 unforgiveness and graduates in our

 hearts when our loved ones betray us two

 things can happen to us we can fall into

 depression the other way is to pick

 yourself up and learn from the lesson

 and then to become stronger instead of

 allowing past relationships to prevent

 us from growing and from learning and to

 become more mature in handling future

 relationships some of us we can become

 afraid some of us say thank God I have

 learned this lesson I've become wiser I

 become better and which is true in life

 failures or success can make this better

 or can make us bitter it is the decision

 that you choose to take for those of us

 who have used our failures in life where

 there's a broken relationship of a

 relationship and we have actually become

 better as a result of these failures of

 these fail relationships and some of us

 are now doing better in life we have

 learned our lesson now we are more

 focused again that is an issue here for

 some people now they are successful they

 have couple of the hurts their failures

 so instead of thanking God for the fact

 that they have become known better they

 become more successful the use of

  success to take revenge to those people who take

 revenge when they are successful in the

 end they were hurt themselves

 God allows everything to happen for

 greater good and so in life we must

 always remember whatever mistakes that

 people have made that we have to me God

 will turn them into moments of grace

 don't ever be great about your past

 don't ever condemn people's past

 everything that happens always remember

 is the part of this whole divine plan

 for our salvation then you will never

 live in regret and then in fact you will

 be able to thank God for your past

 thank God for the mistakes that you have

  made thank God for those times you have gone

 through sufferings because it is all

 within gospel now of course you are

 going through if you are going through

 all course not easy you're going through

 but when the crowd is over then you will

 be able to look back and say thank God

 for all these droughts we are taught to

 be peacemakers we are called to be

 healers or that is to be live givers to

 be hopefully givers as well to bring

 peace because when we do it when we give

 peace to others when we try to heal

  people we will also healed ourselves trust in

 God's grace rely on this grace and that

 is what we do just be patient us always

 be patient you know be patient God has

 the plan and don't get too excited and

 you think oh why like that why you make

 me suffer why not

 know this there isn't time just be

  patient you prey rely on his grace and you will

 see at the end of it

 how beautiful the plan of God is for

 each one of us
