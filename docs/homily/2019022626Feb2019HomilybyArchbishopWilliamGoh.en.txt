 many people spire for leadership whether

 in the Christian community or in the

 world being leaders of course is a great

 gift it's a great calling and today the

 first reading dowsers you know if you

 aspire to serve the Lord prepare

 yourselves for an audience and there's a

 reason why many people you know when

 they start serving the Lord those who

 have been renew in their faith and

 happily like innocent lamb and they join

 the church organizations and they get

 slaughtered and then they leave the

 church they become angry they become

 resentful and they said you know we give

 ourselves we give our service and this

 is what we get so how do we pass through

 this ordeal first and foremost we need

 to be clear of our motives in service

 the truth is many of us do not really

 search the motives in which we are

 caught result the Apostles they were

 arguing among themselves which of them

 was a treatise although we may be

 serving God but have you ever searched

 your real motives is it ready for the

 service of God a service to the

 community or is it about your glory your

 honor your recognition your own

 self-interest and the truth is many of

 us we they're not such deep into

 ourselves the destroyed when Jesus two

 disciples he said you know the Son of

 Man will be delivered in the hands of

 men they will put him to death they did

 not understand what he said and were

 afraid to ask to me we are not ready to

 confront ourselves what the world aspire

 are transferred into the

 religious book so there is always the

 theme today so is temptation whether you

 are an inoperable or whether you are in

 the religious world no one is back

 secondly we have to be clear therefore

 that when we serve the Lord Jesus makes

 it clear that those who serve Him must

 make him sound last of all and servant

 of all it is really a service his call

 for self empty

 it calls for selfie now if you continue

 put yourself as the center of everything

 then this is where we forget that we are

 called to be servants and this is where

 is important for us to purify objectives

 we must be the last a month all a great

 leader therefore is always at the

 service about the city considered

 himself as a real servant secondly those

 even who serve with genuine motives they

 themselves also are not aware that they

 have to carry the cross and Jesus

 despite what the disciples he will be

 put to death and many of us we are not

 fully conscious of this so even when you

 serve you couldn't achieve a fierce

 opposition there will be challenges

 there would be people would not be happy

 with you and so definitely in any area

 of light of the disagreement there were

 be misunderstanding this is part of the

 human world it cannot be avoided is

 inevitable but is how we handle all this

 so for opposition's this

 misunderstanding it is again the

 question of servanthood not all the

 opposition against Azhar necessary back

 sometimes they are meant to bring out

 our own lack of purity of love and

 service or host damn are simply jealous

 and some are envious so how do we had

 the oddest so today the scripture

 readings invites us to have the right

 attitude toward service firstly it's

 important for us to remember that we are

 serving the Lord it is the lot

 admissible so our accountability is not

 even to the boss accountability is not

 even to our workers or fellow colleagues

 of continuity is to god there's wise

 importance is whatever we do that is

 remember who we are serving that is the

 bottom secondly when it comes to service

 we need to be committed commitment to

 the Lord it's very important if you are

 committed to your work you are committed

 to your project if you are committed to

 what you are doing it would not last

 because there is your ego if you are not

 concerned about the work you are doing

 and not concerned with the Lord you will

 fail because idea of the day are serving

 yourself but if you are committed to the

 Lord they are clinging to the Lord that

 all these things will be seen as for the

 service of God and so when we keep our

 eyes on Jesus that what are we doing is

 it really serving the Lord then your

 perspective is very different then you

 are able to change your views you're

 able to be open to the ways God invites

 us to respond so commitment is not to

 your work commitment is not if you are

 committed a lot in the community or is

 the other way around you fall in love

 Jesus you love Jesus person and you will

 know how to do

 if you are committed to the law you will

 do the best capacity and thirdly in

 civic the law there will be challenges

 trials so what happened again it lisa

 sigell houses whatever happens really

 accepted and in uncertainties of your

 harvest education scene school is faster

 than fire and chosen men in the furnace

 of pollution and say aha God is testing

 here you're refining me love so we all

 make mistakes and so even among

 colleagues yeah we are all testing one

 another via our spiritual benefactors

 and benefactress one another not every

 day when Goodman someday in bad mood

 someday we are grumpy something we have

 here some days we are cheerful some days

 we have bit down and so this is for the

 purification is part of love is part of

 grinning community fourthly if you want

 to serve the Lord then we are told you

 must therefore trust him trust see when

 he will uphold you follow a straight

 path and hope in you whoever trusts him

 would not be disappointed and precisely

 the response to rate some say commit

 your life to the Lord trust him and he

 will tag trust in him is important

 sometimes in whatever we do things might

 not appear to be along the way of doing

 the way we want pasinetta he was somehow

 show us the way we need to be patient

 God will unfold his plan for us and so

 we need to have a strong paper firm

 faith don't get discouraged easily don't

 give up because if you commit a lot you

 will never give up because we know the

 Lord was somehow stand by us and give a

 show of it people give up is because

 they give up on them

 there is why the Eva if you'd ever give

 up on the Lord you will never give up on

 yourself you will never give up on

 others so this is where we reminded once

 again responsibly some so beautiful for

 me you'd like to be bought

 trust him and he will act amen
