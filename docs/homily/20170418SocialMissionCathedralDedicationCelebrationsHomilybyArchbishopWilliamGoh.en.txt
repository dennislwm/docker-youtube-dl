 my dear brothers and sisters in Christ

 in the first reading from the book of

 leviticus Moses said be holy for I Lord

 your God and holy my dear friends this

 call to holiness very often is

 misunderstood by many of our Catholics

 we tend to associate holiness with

 ritual purity a holiness to do with

 so-called religious things and for that

 reason many of us think that holiness

 therefore belongs to the priests the

 religious and therefore lay people

 cannot be holy that is why most of you

 when you see me Father I'm a sinner as

 if I'm not and the call to holiness it

 is open to all in fact to be a Christian

 is the desire to be holy otherwise you

 should not be a Christian because to be

 wholly is simply wanting to be my Christ

 priests the religious of course we are

 poor even to a greater height of

 holiness because we are cool to bring

 Christ to you all but holiness is not

 the preserved of priests and religious

 it is a cool

 for all crystals to be horny means to be

 different you know in fact the word

 Pharisee means to be set apart you know

 when you read the gospel we find the

 Pharisees a very particular about the

 way they conduct themselves why because

 they understood that as the paper of God

 they are set apart from the rest of the

 world perhaps I think people think that

 priests and religious are holy because

 we were religious garbed and so set

 apart from the world unlike you all who

 lived in the world but it is not so much

 being set apart to be holy it's not to

 be different simply but to be different

 not so much in our dressing different in

 the way we looking at life different in

 lifestyle that is what it means to be

 holy and therefore a Christian is only

 because the way he things is different

 from the rest of the world simple

 himself said make no mistake about you

 even one of you thinks himself as wise

 in the only sense of the world that you

 must learn to be a fool before he can be

 really wise because the wisdom of this

 world is foolishness to God and so cool

 way of living our attitudes

 mind is different from the world and

 that is the reason why we are holding in

 fact in the gospel Jesus would begin his

 preaching by saying you have learned how

 it was set but now I say he's to you

 there is the distinction the way the

 world looks at situation is different

 from the way Christian look at the

 situation in fact today's gospel which

 is part of the Sermon on the Mount of

 the Beatitudes Matthew chapter 5 6 and 7

 speaks of the radical Chris in lifestyle

 differently from the rest of the world

 my dear brothers and sisters to be holy

 therefore means to be different but to

 be different not for the sake of being

 different different especially in the

 way we deal with our brothers and

 sisters and so it is very interesting

 that when you read the first reading

 from the book of leviticus you notice

 what moses said he said to the people be

 holy for either go you're odd and

 holding the base model offset and

 immediately after this invitation what

 is the next place you must not be hatred

 for your brother in your heart you must

 not exact vengeance you must love your

 neighbor as yourself you notice holiness

 is spell up in terms of how we treat our

 brothers and sisters holiness therefore

 cannot be reduced to simply spending

 buying grain

 Church same grass that is fighting that

 is not holiness holiness is the way we

 live out alive of love and compassion

 despite the responsible son tells us the

 Lord is compassion and love that is what

 holiness is all about and therefore when

 we treat our brothers and sisters like

 Christ then we are holy if we treat our

 brothers and sisters we respect with

 loved with charity simply because as

 Jesus in the gospel tells us they are

 God's children regardless of who they

 are jesus said to them I said you love

 your enemies and pray for those who

 persecute you and what is the reason

 because your father causes his Sun to

 rise on Batman as well as good and is

 going to fall on honest and dishonest

 men tonight in the eyes of God everyone

 it his son his daughter and God loves

 whether you are Catholic or whether

 you're not everyone is loved by the

 father and that's the reason why we are

 going to exercise mercy and compassion

 for all men and women regardless and you

 want who is in mood even if he is unjust

 even if he's cool even if it is even we

 are called to attend to such person and

 secondly same old houses we are called

 to love others simply because he said

 don't you realize that you were God's

 temple the Spirit of God is living a

 monk you why do we treat every human

 person we respect with love from the

 moment of conception until his death

 everyone so long as is a human being so

 long as a creature must be treated with

 respect because simple says you are the

 temple of the Holy Spirit and simple

 answers if anybody should destroy the

 temple of God God will destroy him

 because the temple of God is sacred my

 dear brothers and sisters the social

 mission of the church and that is what

 we are celebrating today therefore is

 the expression of how as the Catholic as

 a Christian we should leave our life in

 holiness so let me tell you the holiest

  people in the church not the priests and

 religious of Osama very holy but not all

 the holiest people in the church are

 these people those were involved in the

 social mission of the church those who

 cares for the pword those who have a

 heart for those what you need the fruit

 of biting the fruit of not of God is

 always loved of nima that is why we love

 God so that we can love our neighbors

 like God that is why you always say the

 beginning of charity is always the love

 of God but it is not a heavy self when

 we love God we begin to love others

 putting on the money and the heart of

 God but be looking at others that's my

 the social mission the church really

 involves the expression of the lady in

 his mission in the world the mission of

 the lady is bread basically to make

 Christ present in the world wherever you

 are before Vatican to social mission the

 church was simply confined to charities

 hospitals and social studies at the

 Vatican to the social mission the church

 is a mid clear Torres it also involves

 in taking part in the social Civic

 political life of the country and

 society aslam that is why the social

 mission the church and you see there are

 25 a place here of Caritas umbrella they

 are all in

 in different forms of service because to

 serve in the mission the church is ready

 to bring the love of Christ but how can

 we do it it is very important for us

 that in the social mission to church if

 we want to exercise cavity service to

 the poor to the underprivileged first

 and foremost my dear brothers and

 sisters justice is the minimum don't

 talk about charity if you can even

 practice justice justice is the minimum

 foundation of charity and my point is

 justice begins at home wherever we are

 because sometimes it can be scandalous

 even within the church or me as a bishop

 I find the greatest enders amount us

 priests religious and you are involved

 in social work we are doing many good

 needs outside our home outside church

 but if we don't exercise justice even in

 our own Catholic environment Catholic

 organizations Catholic ministries how

 can we talk about charity there are many

 Catholics were involved in social work

 but they do not treat your domestic

 helpers we respect the dignity they make

 them work like slaves if we are truly

 Catholics we need to treat our workers

 well make sure they have proper medical

 benefits reiteration

 yes this is minimum if we in the church

 we don't treat our workers well what

 gravity do we have to speak about

 justice and charity and so I think it's

 important for us to ask ourselves how we

 treat even our own Parliament sometimes

 you find work in social services but you

 know at home I have been told I up this

 a harsh to us each other they score each

 other the children have no respect for

 the parents oh but they're very cheap in

 social work in charity so charity mario

 brothers and sisters means be charitable

 to us people who are working ebers and

 living least that's the first basic

 importance cavity but charity goes

 beyond justice charity includes also

 that we must go beyond what Kevin what

 justice demands that's why in the gospel

 in Jesus gives the example I say this to

 you if someone hits you on the right

 cheek offer him the other if someone

 asks for true give him if someone asked

 you to work one man go to mount which

 means to say we need to go beyond

 justice and so in the church the game

 and this is what i always ask of you all

 please please the church is not a

 corporate organisation

 yes we respect is important that our

 rules our governance must meet up to the

 corporate standards today in the world

 surely but it goes beyond their if the

 church is just another corporate

 organization what's the difference in in

 the corporate world hire fire you don't

 do well out you go three stone the world

 treats people depends on productivity

 depends on whether further can produce

 but they cannot be do me the church

 operation the church is a Christian

 organization those of us who are leaders

 we have to exercise compassion and

 understanding because Christian charity

 must also be applied even in our place

 of work but this is just the first part

 okay for the employers employees has the

 same principle which means to say those

 who are working in the church it cannot

 be simply 925 then you are being

 calculated as well it's boob size if we

 are working for God we are working for

 the church we will go even an extra man

 when it is needed as Christine workers

 we also cannot be calculated this is

 what it means because all of us we are

  working all rise we are working for the poor for

 those who are in need when we are

 calculated then we remain on the level

 of justice not on the level of charity

 and even there when we speak but the

 social vision the church it is not

 simply helping people sometimes we need

 to give a voice to those who are

 suffering those who are cool again in

 the first reading the Lord told the

 people you must openly tell him your

 neighbor of this offense this way will

 not take the scene for yourself

 sometimes as church we need to speak on

 behalf of the curve we need to speak

 also in the name of justice because this

 is not responsibility so that some

 people who are not aware of the

 discrimination that is happening in

 society sometime within the church it is

 our duty to speak up but finally the

 social mission the church also requires

 one important in here which is

 forgiveness you know I'm always worried

 sometimes that people who are helping in

 the church in a social mission as well

 they bear a lot of grudges and

 forgiveness in your heart you cannot

 bring the love of Christ in others if

 you are full of anger

 bitterness you will become AG irritable

 in staging that's why Jesus in the

 gospel that reminds us the importance of

 forgiveness to forgive those people who

 heard this is part of this motion nation

 to reconcile people together and so my

 dear brothers and sisters this evening

 as we celebrate the team of social

 mission of the church I pray that all of

 us those of us who truly want to

 encounter the love of God this is what

 we must do we encounter the love of God

 through the service of our brothers and

 sisters when we begin to see the face of

 god in our brothers and sisters then we

 do encounter is loved and as what we've

 been told in the today's reading the

 Lord has blessed us with so many things

 simple says that is nothing to boast

 about in a keening human the president

 of future all your servants they all

 belong to God whatever we have whatever

 blessings that God has given to us and I

 keep on reminding you all these are not

 for ourselves not for us alone when God

 blesses we must be grateful to bless

 others what we have received so that we

 know that truly as we bless others God

 will be pleased with us because the

 father is always happy when we also

 less is other children in this way the

 words of Jesus the command to be perfect

 as a family father is perfect he's

 realized to be perfect simply means to

 be perfect in the way that God loves

 each one of us
