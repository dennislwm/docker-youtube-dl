What is the best way to promote unity? Is secularism the way to unity and peace in the world? Do the people become more united? Are they more holistic? Are they more gracious? Are they more forgiving?
Are they more sacrificing for the country? Or do we have a people, because of secularism, a people without a soul, without a conscience? Because of secularism,
today many people have no more conscience. They cannot tell the difference between what is right and wrong. They cannot tell the difference between falsehood and truth. And that is a real danger. Because people are blind to truth and because that is what relativism is all about, promoted by secularism, since there is no God, no truth. At the end of the day, people are living for themselves. And the world is dangerous because when people start living only for themselves and for this life only,

you will not get people sacrificing themselves for the greater good of the country, for the greater good of the  people.
The world today is confused. This inconsistency. e hand, we want to promote life. On the other hand, we destroy life. That's the reason why the only way today to promote unity in the world is precisely what we are doing - a multi religious, a multi cultural nation, where there is deep respect for one another. And so today, we pray that it is through this mutual respect of people's culture, people's religion, that we can truly promote the common good of society.
We have reasons to give praise and thanks to God because there are very few countries in the world where all religions are respected, where all religions can not just live together but can support each other.
