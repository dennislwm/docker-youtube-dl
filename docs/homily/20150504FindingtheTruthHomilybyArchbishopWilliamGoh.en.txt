 whatever we do in life we have to ask

 ourselves how are we being motivated why

 do we do the things that we do why do we

 will be Commandments in the first

 reading of the x-ray process we read

 about the story of Paul and ballast so you noticed therefore that they began

 to render sacrifices to Paul and

 Barnabus thinking that they were gods

 and did it simply out of fear not

 because they loved the gods but because

 of fear and this fear fear is always

 generated by four-foot feeling is always

 generated because of lives and untruth

 and that is why we find in today's first

 reading what is that forceful the falsehood was

 to believe in the first place that Jesus

 and earnest the devil cost secondly the

 other falsehood the addictive on to was

 to think that the gods will destroy them

 in contrast to all in ballast we find that poor in

 ballast they did what they do because of

 love and truth simple healed equipment

 simply because we read he saw him that

 he had a faith to be cured he did is

 simply out of compassion for this good

 man and so he hears him out of love but

 simple not only acted simply out of love

 he acted in truth you noticed that even

 when sin all human the cricket met it

 was never to draw attention to himself

 it was simply because the men needed to

 be healed

 so you notice simple in Barnabas they

 did the right thing

 because the only one to serve the truth

 and that is why they also told them to

 turn the wheel from this empty idols to

 the Living God who made heaven and earth

 and the sea and all this woe the worship

 others is to worship things that are not

 real less the meaning of ideology means

 emptiness this empty it√≠s as simple

 ptosis therefore cannot give you life

 and this is what we mean when you

 worship power when you worship money

 when you worship glory these things

 cannot give you life that's why they're

 called idols is a simple totem the

 Living God is the God who created and

 and so therefore we come back to the

 pushin the only way and the only reason

 why we do things must be based on love

 and truth and the question therefore is

 this how can we find the truth where is

 the truth to be found because everybody

 sometimes often say we have the truth in

 order to find the truth in today's

 Gospel we have Jesus with I see whose

 cisserus Judas asked Jesus Lord what is

 all this about do we intend to show

 yourself to risk and not to the world in

 other words how can we find the truth

 and you noticed the response of Jesus he

 said anybody who received my Commandments and

 keeps them will be the one who loves me

 and anybody who loves me will be loved

 by my father and I shall love him and

 show myself in him if we want to find

 the truth the truth can only be found in

 love and true love in other words the

 fullness of truth is discovered only in

 loved why if we use only the reason to

 try to find the truth

 the reason alone cannot see the truth

 from the perspective of the other person

 from the perspective of the beloved if

 you use reason to see the truth you see

 the truth only from one perspective that

 is your perspective but when you love

 someone you put yourself in the shoes of

 the person and begin to greet the

 situation more from your perspective

 but from the perspective of the person

 that you loved and that is why in order

 to know the truth it can only be done in

 loved so when we love someone then we

 try to see how the person sees that is

 why when we love someone we tend to be

 more empathetic move for giving more

 understanding because we are looking

 from his point of view but when we do

 not love someone we only look from our

 oil tea so truth can only be discovered

 only enough and true left that's why

 Jesus says anyone who loves me will be

 loved by my father and I sure loved him

 and show myself

 you knew him Jesus will show himself to

 rest if we loved him love therefore is

 the way to the truth and this love is

 expressed of course in obedience of the

 commandments if you love you obey we

 only obey those whom be loved so to love

 Jesus thoses means if anyone loves me he

 will keep my word and my father will

 love him became very important because

 when we obey then love is no more just a

 word of love has become truth truth is

 not the word of truth is not a

 philosophy truth is not an idea truth is

 an event and so the moment when you

 loved you will be at the moment you obey

 what you obey will therefore review to

 rest that it is true so when someone

 tells you something and you love this

 person and in faith you believe what he

 says and you do it then things happen

 that's why truth at the end the day is

 proven in loved truth is proven as you

 lift up the truth you experience the

 truth and therefore we come back to the

 full circle truth is love love is truth

 and this is very clearly brought up

 again in first reading we are told that

 this man he had faith in Jesus he

 trusted in Jesus because he loved Jesus

 when he trusted in Jesus look at him st.</c>


Paul said with a loud voice get with

 your feet stand up and a cripple jump up

 and began to walk in faith he trusted

 simple Dean said he obeyed but he obey

 immediately he could jump out and began

 to walk so if we want to find the truth

 today then we must take the approach of

 love from the perspective of the beloved

 but how can we loved and precisely

 that's why today the fifth week of

 Easter from this week onwards the

 readings of liturgy will be more and

 more on the Holy Spirit

 why because Jesus says that I would get

 the Holy Spirit whom the father will

 send in my name will teach you

 everything reminding of all I have said

 to you when Jesus was on earth he was

 teaching many things he taught us many

 things he knew many truths even until

 today we have not fully understood the

 truth that Jesus has taught to

 understand the truth of what Jesus is

 saying give me the love of God in our

 heart and the Holy Spirit is the love of

 God when we have the love of God in AHA

 then we begin to understand the words of

 Jesus the meaning behind those but

 that's the reason why you noticed those

 who have not fallen in love with God

 when they read the Bible the Bible is

 very boring it means nothing but when

 you fall in love then you feel every

 word Jesus is addressing you because

 Jesus is available then it gives the new

 meaning that's what all those have been

 touched by the Lord the clear sign that

 they have been touched by the Lord the

 following lovely preachers is this what

 we call deep understanding of the word

 of God not true studies a true faith and

 love they begin to read the Bible in a

 new way

 and so from today on with the display

 that will be more conscious of the holy

 spirit the spirit of love that Jesus is

 senators in his fasting and he would

 teach you the fullness of truth and he

 will give us the love of the father and

 the son
