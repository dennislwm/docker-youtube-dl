Why do  fast? We fast because there is an absence of relationship with Jesus.

We fast because we can no longer feel Jesus, simply because we are clouded by so many things in life, because we are attracted by the world and we are too involved in our own lives,  too absorbed in our needs. And therefore we cannot listen to Jesus anymore.
Our relationship is distant. So fasting helps us to keep ourselves disciplined, so that your life is in order,

you know there is a time for everything.
And if you can fast, it means you have a strong will. That is the whole purpose.
Discipline over your words, discipline over the mind.
That's why Friday is a day of fasting because so that we contemplate on Christ's passion,  His sufferings for us,

then we know how much He loves us. And so we know how much He loves us, we know and we respond in love. So fasting help us to identify with the Lord and most of all,

identify with your brothers and sisters. You know when they are suffering, when they are going through pain.  Fasting helps us to identify with those people who are hungry.

The whole purpose of fasting is actually almsgiving, charity, feeling with others,

feeling for others. So we pray during this season that fasting will help us to be more charitable, more merciful.
