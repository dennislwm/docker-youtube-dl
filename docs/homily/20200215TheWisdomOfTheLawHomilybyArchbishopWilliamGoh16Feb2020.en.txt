  so my dear brothers and sisters in  Christ  on the sixth Sunday of the year me  of today'cripture readings is  on the wisdom of the laws of God for  many of us we often think that God is a  joy killer he does not want us to be  happy he is always watching for us to  fall he is our heavenly supervisor  waiting to send us to hell or at least  be barbecued in purgatory for lit the  world and that is the reason why because  of these deep in our hearts actually I  know many Catholics now they resent God  but they cannot say it openly because if  not it would be even deeper in hell and  more fire will come to burn them so deep  in their hearts they are not happy  because God is a lawgiver and we all  want to be free we want freedom to do  things that we light and that's the  reason why many Catholics they become  very legalistic like the scribes and  Pharisees we trying ways and means to  evade the law we try to interpret in  such a way to justify what we do so that  at least our conscience will feel good  about it or sometimes those who fulfill  the laws then they become self righteous  always waiting and watching others who  fail because they feel better than  others and so it's very important for us  to really understand why many of us deep  in our hearts believe that joy God is  the joy healer  I have known many people who do want to  be Catholics at least not now they say  not yet with until I'm ninety nine point  five years old before I die in other  words then I get baptized because once  I get that price I cannot do this I  cannot do that God takes away my freedom  in the Truvy's today the world wants  freedom they want to do things  themselves in the age of second reason  relativism we want to make our own  decisions we know what is right we know  what is good we know better than God in  other words that is why the world in the  end rejects God because having God means  that we have to obey Him we have to obey  the commandments and we want absolute  freedom and this is where it's very  important today that if we really wants  to understand how to look at the law in  such a way that the law brings us true  freedom then we must come to realize the  laws of God are not against earth and  we have no choice really because why we  have created the image and likeness of  God the law of God is planted in our  hearts that is why our conscience would  tell us what is right and what is wrong  because we are created according to the  image in the likeness of God we are  given freedom but we are also created  according to our nature the laws of God  are nothing else but to express the  nature the natural laws that God has set  for creation and all of us if you break  the law actually it is not so much  you are offending God you break the law you  often yourself you offend others because  you are going against your nature so we  tell you this Kenda is hot don'ouch  and you see want uch because you  get burnt no because your body cannot  withstand the heat so the laws are not  created by God established by God  to make our lives miserable rather to  protect us to help us to live a life of  true freedom and this is where Jesus in  the  reminds us therefore that no it is  important that your virtue goes no  deeper if your virtue goes no deeper  than their the scribes and Pharisees you  will never get into the kingdom of  heaven so if we are just looking at the  laws externally if it's a question of  just fulfilling the letter of the law  we will go nowhere that's right the loss  becomes oppressive when we are trying to  fulfill the letter of the law what we  need to do is to understand the spirit  of the law so that we can apply the laws  intelligently into our lives and to make sure that the laws given by God which is  part of this whole creation it is for  our good and so today Jesus helps us to  understand how we should apply the laws  intelligently not like the scribes and  the Pharisees and so in the Gospel he  gives us three example what are these  four examples firstly the Lord said you  should not get angry many of us get  angry easily no problem with the English  the small sin year it might look smaller  but you know big sins comes from small  seen first you get angry then you become  resentful  then you bear grudges and then it begins  to what we call work in you and then  embellished and then you want the  revenge anger will lead to killing and  violence  nobody become violent overnight it is  because they allow the anger you know to  grow in their hearts and anger  ultimately will kill not just your  enemies before you can kill the enemy  the anger might have killed you first I  remember this story manipulate I read  many years ago you know people who  Picasa  they are all looking for the parking lot  you know and the guy he was waiting for  the  and this guy came up behind there was an  empty lot in nearly he went in oh he was  angry and both them fought the chaton  each other and the men got heart attack  and died on the spot so you know you get  angry your high blood pressure in the  end you destroy your own life if you are  angry person you cannot think properly  you make stupid decisions because you  are angry you're not come so anger  doesn't do anyone any good so   just a question of oh I'm angry  and so God is angry God is not angry God  he said that we are angry and we are  destroying ourselves another example the  Lord is given in the questions of  committing adultery he said you know if  a man looks at a woman lustfully has  already committed adultery with her in  his heart and people say being a  Christian so difficult even thinking  services in without an action but you  know the truth is all actions begins  with conception before you can give  birth to a baby first must consistent so  when you put you conceive in your mind  well eventually we make present in your  action so all actions begins with some  ideas and these ideas will grow and same thing   so when the man is last will  first you begin to thing and then you  fall into sin then the gains you know we  need to talk about the sin of loss when  the sin of loss people think it is all  right but you look at all the  implications the consequences of the sin  of lust  it destroys family life adultery between  husband and wife not only destroy the  marriage destroy your children have you  thought it through a man and woman a boy  and a girl they stick together  especially boys and girls not many boys  and go to the even people are very young  you know 15 16 they already sleeping  with each other they taught true if the  girl gets pregnant what is going to  happen but they never think true  now the voyeurism rape molestation have  people taught true that will they do  something the whole lives will be  destroyed so the woman when you start  conceiving these ideas these last two  ideas  it will give birth to action and that  time you will destroy your life that is  the reason why we must always avoid even  last few thoughts not just lustful  actions because last few actions comes  from lustful thoughts then the and  example that Jesus give is a question of  swearing you must not swear Jesus ly  don't worry about the reason that Jesus  give the point is that if you swear it  means to say no one trusted you if  people don'rust in your work you can  swear a thousand times swear by heaven  swear by Earth it doesn't mean just  because you swear your work is truth so  it's important so if we want to be a  person who is respectable integrity of  life if you are a man of integrity  whatever you say  he will be at peace and you will be  convicted it's only when the person  is not true to himself whatever he says is  always ambiguous and he gives the  impression that he is not to be trusted  so we know my dear brothers and sisters  today the Scripture readings provides us  really the key to happiness the response  rasam tells us they are happy who follow  God's law they are happy who follows  God's law and to be able to follow God's  law what is needed we need  the wisdom of God and where can we find the wisdom of  God's import tells us in today'econd  reading these are the very things that  God has revealed to us through the  spirit for the spirit reaches the depths  of everything  even the depths of God if we want to  understand the Scriptures well to be  able to discern what is truly good for  us we must always seek the help of the  holy spirit who would teach us the truth  and once we know the truth then we  should act on it because the Lord tells  us this again in today's first reading  the Lord said man has life and death  before him whichever man lies better  will be given to him and he said if you  wish you can keep the commandments to haved  faithfully is within your power  so don't blame God don't blame others  God has given us the power to choose what is right and what is wrong
