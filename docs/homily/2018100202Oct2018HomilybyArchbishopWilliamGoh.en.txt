Angels are sent by God to help us to find our salvation, to guard us, to protect us and to guide us. So faith in the angels is an important dogma of our faith because if you don't believe in angels then you won't believe in the presence of the evil one as well. If you don't believe in the presence the evil one you cannot also believe in the presence of God because God is pure spirit. We are called to be reverential towards angels.
We are asked to pray to the angels.

Praying to the angels helps us to be conscious of the angels' presence in our lives. But it's not enough just to pray to the angels, we are called also to listen to the angels because the angel represents the presence of God. Precisely angels are called messengers in order to convey God's will for us.

The voice of the angels that you hear would be the voice that comes from your prayer. Obedience to the voice of the angels is important. It's not enough just to hear the angel or to be protected by him, it's important to imitate him in his prayer of praise and thanksgiving. It is important that we become also angels to others. All of us, we are called to be messengers of God by taking care of each other, by being good to one another. We need to also become symbols of God's presence to others. Therefore especially in times of trouble, in times of need,

let us besides praying to your favorite saint, you also have a guardian angel to protect you.
