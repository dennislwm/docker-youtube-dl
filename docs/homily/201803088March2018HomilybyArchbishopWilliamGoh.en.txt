 the Scripture readings of this morning

 are indeed very challenging and also a

 warning from the Lord because of the

 situation and the state that we are in

 we are no better than the people during

 the time of Prophet Jeremiah we can do

 lots of things you know we can attend

 even daily Mass and do all kinds of

 religious pious exercises but that is

 not what the loved ones those are means

 those expressions of our love for God

 and our desire to live his life or as

 expression of our repentance for our

 sins but just offering all these

 sacrifices will not make us happy and

 it's not going to make God happy if you

 were to look at the issues confronting

 us today I think right from the start is

 important for us to know what are the

 real issues and where we are riving or

 at least acknowledge that we have not

 arrived I think there's not Pope Francis

 or some of the tells us these are the

 ideals of the church but we have we are

 not there it's okay now this you can go

 Pope Francis is a compassionate you know

 divorce is not the idea yes like the

 contraceptive is not the ideal we want

 to protect the ideal but if you cannot

 make it then we need to make some

 progression we need to discern how we

 can arrive I think what is important is

 us ourselves

 and we truly loving and so society is

 moving the direction let me tell you

 it's moving the direction is about

  myself is in the day if you major you should

 look at all the things that we are doing

 it's about myself individualism my own

 freedom my own is others a second so

 with the baby second put the elderly

 second put the even for marriage we put

 the other person second so it's my

 pleasure that is more important it's not

 about love as much pleasure

 so everything so at the end the day

 history will judge as

 if we follow these steps and we continue

 to adapt the laws to materia to suit

 human selfishness history will judge us

 and then we will see all the backlashed

 maybe not today 20 30 40 50 s time you

 will see the backlash they say today the

 gospel said we need to have a strong

 hand Jesus is the stronger in this way

 today we are asked to pray that Jesus

 will be our strong men so that we know

 how to act
