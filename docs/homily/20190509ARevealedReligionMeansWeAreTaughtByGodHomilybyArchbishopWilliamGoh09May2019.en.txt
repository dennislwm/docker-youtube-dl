When we speak about faith, it is a reasoned faith. It is not pure rationalism. Which means to say, even for us to claim to have faith in Jesus, we must be able to show in an intelligible way why we make this act of faith. So, faith must have reasons to support us. It cannot be just simply according to one's whim and fancy. For us to come to faith in Jesus as the revealer of God, first and foremost, we need to be drawn by God. So, faith is a gift.

And in the same way too, God draws us to Him in situations. There could be a hunger, there could be a hurt, or there could be a restlessness in the heart. We must always remember in order to bring faith to people, we need gentleness,
we need to be sensitive. When can we talk to the person. There is always a right time.
We need to be in strong relationship with Jesus, so that we will know when and how to bring Him to others.
