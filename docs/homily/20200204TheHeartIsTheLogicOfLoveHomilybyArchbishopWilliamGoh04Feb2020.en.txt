When you love someone, there is no sacrifice that is difficult. It is only when you don't love, then every sacrifice is painful. So when you find that you are getting irritable with people, you are getting angry with people,

the problem is not that the person is doing something wrong.

It's because you lack love. Your love has limits, that's why. When there is no love,

when your love is limited, of course you'll get very angry, you'll throw temper, you'll become violent. So the problem is actually the capacity. This capacity to love will give us faith as well. So you need to have faith. When you have faith,

you'll lead the person also to have faith and confidence in himself. So when you have faith, even if your child is an ingrate, even if someone is very difficult to love, that person will change. So at the end of the day, what's the problem? Lack of love, lack of faith.

If you have enough love, you would be able lerate somebody, even though it's difficult, If you have enough faith, the person you tolerate, even though difficult, will one day change.

So we pray for this gift of deeper faith and deeper love, so that we can truly love those who are difficult.
