when people have bills against us we are called to exercise compassionate what is this question of Justice then isn't justice a presumption that the right things should be done those who have done wrong thing should be corrected it would be a greater injustice if we use compassion to allow someone to perpetuate something that is wrong that is evil it will cause even more hurt how does God contain within himself the need to exercise justice at the same time compassion these two qualities they are not contradicting each other their different aspects of how we deal with wrongful situations in life e hand God's compassion is highlighted but there is also the question of punishment as well these two cannot be separated although they are distinct why does the Lord alot good and evil to coexist because in every one of us in every human heart there is this reservoir of goodness is important to relieve that every human being has tremendous witnessed of course sometimes wrongly placed but there is goodness but also in each one of us there is also this potency to evil as well and that is why you know God is very compassionate to us all he knows who we are he knows that we sinners at the same time he want to be good and that is why he is rich in compassion he knows our struggles he has gone through the human struggles to fight sinned against Satan and so he knows is one of us very well how much we are trying and how much we have been tried every day the reason why God is compassionate because he feels because he identifies with us it's very difficult to differentiate between what is good and what is evil especially in today's world influenced by relativism and so just as God is patient members we are called to be patient with one another when God forgives us he does not hold grudges against us that is what it means it doesn't mean to say that if you forgive someone there are no consequences there would be consequences so it's just that I don't harbor evil but the consequences sometimes are beyond our control what you reaped is what you sow and so when a person does something wrong certain punishment wrought upon by circumstances will happen the Lord invites us to exercise compassion in a way that we relate with people in the way we accept people the way we deal with people who offend us but at the same time it is important for us to take note that those of us who fail and we are going through the consequences of our sins again those are moments of grace as well because God gives a punishment the consequences of sin in order to help us to be purified so in both ways even in the sufferings that we go through it is also a compassion of God and so this thank God even when he Allah punishments who happen to us it is also a great egg of compassion
