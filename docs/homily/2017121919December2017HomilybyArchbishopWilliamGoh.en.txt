 today we are taught to reflect the

 purpose of having Shirin

 in Christian life what is the real

 vocation of a mother of a father why do

 we have children the first reason do

 have a child is the way in which couple

 grow in love when they are married

 whether single a person who is loving

 always generates life so that is the

 reason why a true love brings about life

 to others even the father and a son they

 love each other so much but you see the

 father and son they poured up their love

 into the world in the Holy Spirit's way

 you are created because of the love of

 God that's the first reason second

 reason you have children means that we

 want to grow in the love of God in the

 life of God your charm is not yours your

 child belongs to God the only trustees

 the most important thing we can do for

 children is to help them to find their

 vocation in life because every child has

 the mission in this world and your past

 as parents is not complete until you

 help them to find the vocation their

 mission in life every child must be a

 joy and delight to the world if they

 find a vocation

 they were always be happy and when

 everybody leaves the vocation their life

 is complete their life is full and yet I

 would be very passionate every day to be

 living to bring a difference in the

  world so this is where it is important that

 the parents must influence the parents

 must pray must discern
