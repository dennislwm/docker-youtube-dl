  on his first Sunday of Lent the Lord is

 inviting us to live the new life in

 Christ the season of Lent is to prepare

 us for the celebration of the Paschal

 mystery the passion death and

 resurrection for Lord which is to share

 in his resurrected life when we speak of

 sharing the light of God again it is

 important for us to understand what

 causes left when we speak of death we

 are not simply speaking of physical

 death we are speaking of an eternal

 depth we are speaking of a spiritual

 depth and so today simple tells us the

 reason why although many of us are

 physical physically alive but we are

 dead and this is because simple said

 scene entered the world through one man

 and truce in depth and his death has

 spread through the whole human race

 because everyone has sinned so the cause

 of death is because of Satan of sin of

 temptation unfortunately my dear

 brothers and sisters the world is

 ignorant the world does not believe in

 Satan anymore the world does not know

 that there is such a thing called sinned

 this is the greatest challenge in our

 world today the world thinks that they

 know everything they say that Satan evil

 spirits they are just mythological

 feeders they are not real the world

 because of secularism and the Coralie is

 more related relativism tell us there is no right there is no

 wrong and if there is no right there is

 no wrong if everything is a matter of

 preference then there is no sin so just

 be pragmatic choose what you think is

 good for you I noticed my dear brothers

 and sisters the world think that science

 and technology would change the world

 the science and technology is the

 solution to all the worse problem and

 that is why today people they are

 desperate they want to acquire as much

 knowledge as possible the Internet

 information technology because they

 think knowledge will conquer the world

 this was precisely the temptation of

 Adam and Eve the woman was in the garden

 and the problems of Adam and Eve they

 wanted all knowledge they wanted to be

 like God but without God this precisely

 is the arrogance of the world they want

 to be like God they want to have full

 control over everything but they do not

 want have one god to interfere in their

 lives and so my dear brothers and

 sisters what the world is saying

 contradicts what scripture is saying

 today in the scripture reading it is

 clear that Satan evil spirits sin

 temptation they exist they are real in

 the gospel we have Jesus was tempted by

 the Evil One and in the first reading of

 course the story of the fall of Adam and

 Eve and this temptation of the evil one

 it is real that is why the Holy Fathers

 from Pope Paul the six until the current

 Pope they often speak of this delusion

 that the devil is deceiving the world

 telling the world that he does not exist

 all the holy father speaks of the

 reality of Satan and evil spirits of course I disagree with that because

 science is based on empirical proof but

 my dear friends the spiritual world

 cannot be tested empirically that is why

 science and technology is ignorant of

 the reality of the evil one and devil is

 very happy because that is a strategy

 the devil is using to subdue the world

 because if we all believe that he does

 not exist then we will not put up our

 defense that is why the devil today he

 is very subtly destroying the world

 redefining gender marriage and family

 the devil is subtly promoting the

 culture of death abortion euthanasia

 terrorism violence Wars and abuse of the

 ecology merciful the devil today is in

 the name of relativism normalizing evil

 as good and that is happening all over

 the world but the greatest instrument

 the devil's using today to destroy the

  world is to confuse our identity you notice

 that in today's gospel three times the

 devil asked Jesus if you are the son of

 God if if if the devil wanted Jesus to

 have doubts over his identity if you do

 not know your identity you cannot live

 your life meaningfully and that is what

 the devil is doing to us all

 the devil is confusing men of our

 identity the devil is saying that we are

 just animals material creatures we do

 not have a soul there is no life after

 death if that were the case then you

 have only one life to live and you have

 only one life then you better make the

 best of it

 enjoy as much as you can why be bothered

 about the world why be board about your

 future because there is no future you

 enjoy as much as you can now because

 when you die everything is over that's

 the reason why we have forgotten that we

 are created in image and likeness of God

 we have forgotten our identity which is

 to share in the life of God this

 confusion of identity is what actually

 has destroy humanity but you know many

 of brothers and sisters the temptation

 of Satan is not just the only one we

 also tempted to the world tempted by our

 flesh that is why in today's Gospel we

 have Satan trying to destroy Jesus by

 tempting him to pleasure to glory to

 power the devil tempted Jesus to change

 stones into loaves of bread because he

 was hungry the devil wanted Jesus to use

 his power for himself and that is what

 the world is doing use whatever powers

 you have whatever talents yes for

 yourself not for the service of Palace

 again the devil tempted Jesus to jam

 from the parapet of temple to prove to

 demonstrate that he is the son of God

 again we use power and glory to subdue

 people to many play people and finally

 the devil tempted Jesus to bow down and

 worshiped him and that is what we are

 tempted to glory wealth power so we know

 my dear brothers and sisters how can we

 avoid leaving a living left adept it

 never dies today

 during the season of Lent the church in

 vices to fast and to pray like Jesus the

 Israelites were in the desert for 40

 years but they feel they never learned

 their lesson Jesus was in the desert for

 forty days fasting and praying because

 fasting brings us nearer to God

 fasting helpers to en for God fasting

 helpers to deepen our prayer life but

 it's not just prayer life very most

 important instrument that we should use

 to fight against the evil one

 and people ask how do I fight with the

 evil one how can I win the battle

 you notice today Jesus showed us the way

 use the word of God for every temptation

 that the devil put onto him

 he cited from scriptures to dispel the

 temptation of the Evo if you know your

 Scripture well every time when you are

 tempted every time when you are confused

 then the scripture were enlightened you

 instead of allowing the world to confuse

 your values if you are grounded in the

 Word of God but the problem is many of

 us we hardly know the Word of God

 in fact the devil knows the Word of God

 better than us he can even cite the

 scripture to tell Jesus the Angels will

 protect you if we jump from parapet

 rocketing jesus knew his Bible better

 than the devil so it's not enough just

 to know the Word of God we must know

 better than the devil because you use

 the Word of God even to confuse us my

 dear brothers and sisters in a final

 analysis that let's remember this this

  is this the second reading for me is the

 most beautiful reading if you have time

 read it all over again so beautiful

 because in our battle against the evil

 one same post guarantees us do not be

 afraid do not fear we will try them and

 why are we so certain that we'll try

 them over evil

 even sometimes when you see that the

 world is going the wrong way

 everything seems to be collapsing it is

 not true love life would triumph over

 death and hatred because this is what's

 impulsive if he's certain that death

 reigned over everyone as the consequence

 of one man's fall it is more certain

 that one man Jesus Christ will cause

 everyone to reign in life who received a

 free grief that he does not deserve or

 being made righteous again he said if

 one man's fall brought condemnation on

 everyone so the good egg of one man

 brings everyone life and makes them

 justified so with this confidence that

 is therefore join Jesus in our warfare

 against Satan evil spirits and most of

 all from all temptations
