In every life ,there are always problems,
we always have challenges, we always have difficulties, and we also have the presence of evil and the presence of sin. In the face of evil, in the face of issues and problems, we do not allow all these to overcome us. Rather we should triumph and transcend all these so-called challenges in our life. And metimes God allows the presence of evil and sufferings in us in order to, first and foremost, purify us. And that is the fact of life. In life, we grow best only when we start interacting with one another. In life we grow best only when we meet challenges, when we meet difficulties. This is where we learn to know ourselves better. We know where we stand and it helps us to clarify our own thoughts. So all these things are part and parcel of life and of growth. It is important for us to realise that the sufferings in life, they are meant to purify us, to be more forgiving, to be more loving. It is through suffering that we grow in our interior life. It is only when you have been tested, when you have been challenged, and then we learn to let go. The more you learn to let go,
the more you learn to accommodate, the happier we  become. The holiest person is one who loves everybody, who is non-judgmental, who can live with everybody, who can accept everybody. God wants to fine tune us. God wants to strengthen our virtues. That is why he allows all these irritations to take place. The sufferings that we go through,

they help us to recognise the mercy and the love of God. It helps us to draw us to God. metimes, sufferings are important so that we don't feel that we are so independent, that we can solve every issue. And that keeps us humble, to always cling to God, to turn to him for help and to recognise that God is the one who makes all things possible.

Let us pray that we will be more receptive and not to take all these struggles in life negatively, but to use them for our good and for the growth of holiness.
