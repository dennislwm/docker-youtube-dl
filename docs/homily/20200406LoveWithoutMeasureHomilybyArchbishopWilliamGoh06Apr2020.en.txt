  today we enter Monday of Holy Week the  Scripture readings of the day one says  to reflect on the depth of all daft for  the Lord very often in life we will ask  our loved ones  how much do you loved me this was the  same question that Jesus asked Peter  after his resurrection do you loved me  and three times Peter said yes only then  the Jesus tell Peter follow me to the  cross it is true that love demands all  love is a total surrender of oneself my  dear brothers and sisters if Jesus were  able to ask Peter for his total love and  commitment to him it was because he  himself has first loved him and the  apostles and all of us completely indeed  in a next chapter of John 13 which we  will read on Holy Thursday we are told  that before Jesus ascended to his father  he loved his own to the very end that is  how Jesus loves us he reserved nothing  for himself his loved was complete he  loved us so much that he assumed our  humanity and as we read in yesterday's  Palm Sunday second reading from  Philippines it was not enough to be one  with us  in our sufferings but he surrendered  himself to the most shameful death on  the cross that one could ever think  of and Jesus his whole life was a life of  oblation he was giving himself in  service to us all forgiving our sins  healing the sick bring consolation to  the widows raise the dead exorcise those  who were oppressed by evil spirits and  always proclaiming the gospel of love  and mercy there was how Jesus loves us  indeed he is the one that is prophesied  in today's was reading he is a suffering  servant indeed the very first verse here  is my servant whom I uphold my chosen  one in whom my soul delights it's a  reference to Jesus remember when he was  baptized the heavens opened and said  this is my beloved Son in whom I am well  pleased and Jesus as the suffering  servant prophesied in Isaiah he's the  one endowed with the Spirit of God  bringing through justice to the nation  and we are told he does not cried out or  shout aloud he doesn't break the crush  read not punish the wavering flamed the  way Jesus went about his ministry was a  man of non-violence he did not resist  his enemies he did not try to destroy  them he did not respond in violence as  many people do today when those people  who try to hurt them they take revenge  they kill even not for Jesus he's a humble servant  without malloced without anger he  submitted himself so humbly like a lamb  being led to the slaughter house this is  the spirit of Jesus a spirit of his  father one who brings about true justice  again not the power not be violence  not with arms but with mercy and  forgiveness and compassion this  is a true spirit of Jesus and that is a spirit of the Father the Spirit of God  indeed my dear brothers and sisters as we journey with Jesus in this patient  today we are called to imitate matter  and Nazareth who welcomed Jesus and then  we are told Mary express his love for  the Lord  Mary was one of those who have been  delivered by the Lord she had  encountered Jesus unconditional love and mercy  that is why she loved Jesus in return  without reservation and this is true  when we are loved without reservation we love without reservation  Mary was willing to spend 300 denarii on  that point Minh to prepare his body for  burial 300 denarii was a lot of money it  was a years waged for ordinary laborer  but you know when we love we do not  count  when we loved we do not mention love in  monetary terms when we loved we give  whatever we have we share  whatever we got in fact when we love whatever we  have money wealth things they are meant  to be lavished on our lover on our  beloved we don't even think of holding  these things for ourselves no we just  want to make our beloved happy we are in  fact very happy to sacrifice what we  like what we treasure because we loved  and not only that Miri love Jesus  profusely without being abashed we are  told she uses her hair and the tears to  white the feet of Jesus to what Jesus  feet drying she was not afraid to make  a fool of herself she stooped down like a  servant  again repairing us what Jesus would  himself do at the Last Supper like a  servant he emptied himself street behave  like a servant is utter the wash the  feet of his disciples know when you love  to begin we are not conscious of where  we stand before our beloved when we love  we know our beloved were always embraces  no matter what we do we can be  comfortable with our beloved we don't  have to put on the show we don't need  make-up  makeup for those people who are not too  sure of the love of others that's why  people put out makeup  just only ladies even then today put a  become because why they want people to  love them but if you have found your  beloved you don't need all this because  love is in the heart then you can just  be free and Miri was so free before the  dog because she felt loved  she knew Jesus love was there always  there but not for Judas and getting the  gospel again we are taught   was making noise not happy why he said  this ointment could have been given the money could have been given to the poor  only people who do not love think that  way when we count love and mention love  in terms of money that is no more loved  that is why Judas had no love for the  Lord he tried to make excuses to save  the money and that is what we do when we  do not loved then we find excuses we try  to reason why we should not give to this  person why we don't give to the poor  we give all kinds of excuses because we  have no loved but when you loved you  don't make excused you respond not with  your head you respond with your heart  and my dear brothers and sisters this is  precisely what we are taught to do we  are called to love like Mary so I asked  you how much do you love Jesus are you  ready to accept the sufferings of Jesus  are you ready to loved the way Jesus has  loved us  are we ready to give ourselves  that is questioned we are reflection today
