 we are taught to be leaders in our own

 ways but is very important that leaders

 must be rightly motivated leadership is

 really to make Jesus present to help

 people to encounter God and his presence

 in this unto us leader must not be a

 lover of money it is not the material

 things that should motivate us or

 sometimes that is the danger we can be

 motivated by pride by ego by ambition so

 motives have to be clear on one you want

 to serve God why we want to be a leader

 what are the qualities of leadership the

 first see of leadership is character the

 character is not built overnight

 character means that we are taught to

 act from our being doing must flow from

 our being from our own convictions from

 our own values and so an impacted by

 character does not mean to say we are

 flawless that is not what we mean

 impeccable character is one therefore

 that is steady one that is growing if we

 do not have a right character or that we

 said no one will believe this without

 commitment without single-mindedness a

 leader cannot make progress so the focus

 is very important commitments means if

 I'm working on persevering sometimes if

 you like giving up sometimes you are

 tired a commitment means to say we were

 just carry on believing cooperating with

 the grace of God once we are clear of

 commitment we just keep on going ahead

 never looking back with commitment you

 also need to become a calm mind a calm

 heart is possible only when you are

 brain person otherwise you're going to

 react to every situation self-control is

 very important

 without discipline you cannot be a

 leader that's when many people wants to

 have to be leaders without discipline it

 is not possible a leader will always be

 loved when the leader shows compassion

 when the leader is empathetic when the

 leader is able to forgive others and

 sensitive to others that is very notice

 in the new world the leader doesn't sit

 in his office

 the leader is walking around talking

 with others the leader is connecting

 with the staff he is asking the staff

 what they feel what they think is

 interested in the lives of the stuff

 that is then we will form people and the

 leader knows what is going on what are

 the struggles but that the pains what

 are the needs is what leadership is

 about the decisions we make must come

 from the fact that we in touch of what

 people he because at the end of the day

 but does a leader do the leader tries to

 meet the needs of his people a leader

 must be conscientious in his spiritual

 life a leader is one who brings fun

 sensors the leader is one brings unity

 Bishop is how we build the people

 together how we bring consensus how we

 meet the people one leadership is about

 how we succeed together as an

 organization as a team

 it's not about the leader the leader is

 the one who makes sure that everyone in

 organization is maximizing his or her

 potentials and when that happens then we

 become truly a family
