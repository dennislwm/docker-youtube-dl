Many of us, although we call ourselves Catholics, we say we are a family, we say we belong to the house of God, but we are more concerned with our own houses than the house of God. We are more concerned for our own families than the family of God.

There are many Catholics not coming to Church.

Two-third of them are not accounted for. And the one-third, hardly 15% are active in Church.

Many Catholics, they just come for Sunday Mass. There is no faith in them. Many young people leave after Confirmation. Hardly twenty percent of the people go for regular or once-a-year Penitential Service. Hardly twenty percent. And so it is good for us to ask ourselves, are we complacent?  We are indifferent to what is happening in the Church. And very soon in time to come, our younger generation will have no faith. They will know other values.
Their relationship with God become more and more distant. The values that they will imbibe will be the values of the world.

They will be raised without the presence of God in their lives. Our future generation, they might have money. They might have beautiful houses. They might have plenty to spend but they have no life.
There is no meaning. There is no stability. There is no purpose. Their lives would be just in a mess. Their lives would be empty. So it does not mean to say that providing all the material needs alone can fulfill their lives.  So let us pray that we will not fall into the sin of regret.
