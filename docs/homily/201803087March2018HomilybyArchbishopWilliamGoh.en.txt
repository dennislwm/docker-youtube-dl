 the loss of God given to us they are

 meant to guide us they are going to help

 us to live the fullness of life they not

 meant to delimit our life in fact laws

 are not limiting life they meant to help

 us to live on life in such a way that we

 can live in harmony and so it is

 important for us for us to really see

 the wisdom of the laws so it's not it's

 not a question of blindly obeying the

 laws so can you see the wisdom so those

 of us will disagree that you just lost

 our tutors doctrine before you disagree

 do you understand what is the foundation

 the purpose of the moral teaching of the

 church do you understand where the

 church is coming from can you see the

 validity and the benefits and the wisdom

 of what the church is saying so it's not

 a question of I agree or disagree

 understanding the law is important which

 me to say no Catholic therefore should

 just obey the law blindly nowadays we

 are all educated you can greet you can

 try to understand why is the church

 teaching this law you can disagree but

 you need to find up before you disagree

 why is the church teaching certainties

 if you understand then of course you can

 accept it you can embrace it

 so our task is whatever difficulties you

 have with the church's law the first

 thing is not to oppose the first thing

 is try to understand that is why either

 to just teaching we make it clear huh

 whatever that just teaches the first

 thing we have to do is what we call

 religious submission don't miss will and

  intellect your will intellect I surrender that

 means I will try to put my mind in my

 will according to the mind and the other

 church I mean you try to understand

 where the church is coming from

 they're after that you can make your own

 assessment and so Jesus precisely today

 in the gospel tells us that all laws are

 meant to give life and so that's why we

 say I've come not to abolish the law I

 come to fulfill so it is love it is

 wisdom it is understanding that makes

 the law but we call in our favor so

 doing everything law Sciences

 if those against us basically because of

 our selfishness because it goes against

 our selfish interests if you really want

 to help people to be happy then we need

 to not just only punish punishment

 doesn't help is prevention prevention

 preemptive measure so let us therefore

 ask a lot to help us not to purify and

 that love for him and for honest
