 God is not looking for perfect people

 God is looking for people before heart

 of not for him there is all that is

 required and God will make use of us

 wonderfully you need to have faith fear

 comes about when we are in communion

 with God fear comes about when we hear

 the word of God what the Lord wants of

 us is obedience obedience is better than

 anything else if we do the will of God

 then this is where we become members of

 his family so what the Lord asks of us

 today is that we should therefore a lot

 of the Word of God who come into our

 life the Eucharist cannot be effective

 in our lives unless we have prepared

 ourselves we have listened to the word

 we have prayed over the word it is where

 the word will help us to be more

 appreciative to be more conscious of

 what we're celebrating
