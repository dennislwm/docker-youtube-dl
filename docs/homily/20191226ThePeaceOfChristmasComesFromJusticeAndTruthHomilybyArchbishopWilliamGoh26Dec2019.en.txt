The peace that Christmas comes to bring, it is a peace that is based on truth. This is very much unlike the peace in the world. Nobody wants to speak the truth because if you speak the truth, you are unpopular. And that is why the unity of the world today is very fragile because it is not founded on truth. Sometimes truth is rejected because people are ignorant.

Many people are confused over what is right,
what is wrong because of social media. Because they don't have the right source of information.
And so, many are ignorant. What must we do in order for Christ to be born in our hearts,
in order that we can reflect Jesus in our lives? We need to listen to the Holy Spirit.
We need to listen to the truth. We need to have the Spirit of Jesus in our hearts. We cannot speak the truth unless we have seen,

unless we have heard. Truth cannot be proclaimed unless there is a personal conviction. Speaking the truth is one thing but are we living the truth? That is even more important. At the end of the day, it will be a sign. Signs of our own lives of how we live the life of Christ that will change people. Not so much what we say but what we do. So people need to see us really living the life of Christ in our offices, in our families, in society. Always reflecting the life of Christ in us, reflecting the mysteries of Christ in us. That means to say, people must see in us that we are like Jesus, dying to self and living a life of love and service. It's not enough to speak the truth. We must speak the truth with charity and for the sake of charity. You have to ask yourself, are you speaking out of love for the person or for the love of yourself?
