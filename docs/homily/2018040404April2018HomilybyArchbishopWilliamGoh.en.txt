 so how then to reduce before suffering

 Jesus give us the larger context of

 suffering every suffering must be seen

 within context when we look at suffering

 the first thing is you have to recognize

 that we are solidarity in suffering it's

 the other cutters causing us to suffer

 we also cause others to suffer so try to

 see your suffering in the larger context

 of a sinful humanity the despair of

 coping with suffering is to understand

 suffering we have different roles to

 play and suffering they have a purpose

 if you understand the purpose and that

 was what Jesus try to do to help people

 to understand the place of your

 suffering so even our suffering there is

 a point that time and God will know when

 to heal us when to take away our

 sufferings so if we suffer patiently

 then this suffering will ultimately for

 his glory

 for our salvation for the salvation of

 others so once we understand the place

 of suffering in our life

 for the greater good for the glory of

 God and God has a plan so this crippled

 man is suffering being in fact that he

 was healed by the Lord that helped him

 to appreciate life better and most of

 all know who is his Savior if you find

 that you cannot see beyond a suffering

 what must you do celebrating you

 charissa why you Chris first and

 foremost we have the Word of God the

 Word of God will open your eyes then

 give you a moment enlightened and say

 okay praise God praise God for my

 sufferings so if you are able to thank

 God for the sufferings that you go

 through miss you up you means that you

 are liberated if you can tango for your

 sufferings for your trust

 it means to say you have embraced every

 Eucharist is what a celebration of the

  patch the resurrection of a law so every

 Eucharist is where we remember how Jesus

 died and how he roasts and so by serving

 Eucharist it gives us hope because we

 now could see the connection between the

 suffering of Christ why he suffered and

 how heroes for upset so we -</c> when we

 serve the Eucharist

 it is a Thanksgiving to be able thank

 God for the things that have happened to

 us -</c> they will tingle especially for our

 mistakes for our sinfulness for the past

 that we had done wrong and if we can

 angle nice be acute and if you cannot

 thank God for your past mistakes or your

 past sins means you're not here you're

 not you

 so you Krissy see thank you and not only

 the Eucharist has to connect all the

 events that's why every time instead of

 the mass the mass is so beautiful or the

 events of life actually are connected

 and brought together and they're given

 meaning when we connected with Jesus

 passion death and resurrection and

 finally we are -</c> after that they the

 eyes were opened they quickly went back

 and all of them assemble together and

 they started to share so this is where

 again we encourage each other and if

 meaning so beautiful that's so beautiful

 amen
