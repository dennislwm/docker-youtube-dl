  my dear brothers and sisters in Christ  in the first reading Moses addressed  people and he said I call heaven and  earth to witness against you today I  said before your life or death blessing  or cursed my dear brothers and sisters  the choice is obvious surely we all  choose life surely we choose blessings  no one will want to choose death or  cursed and yet the irony of humanity is  this instead of choosing life we choose  death instead of choosing blessings we  choose curses the way we live our life  seems to contradict what we desire and  this very important question for each  one of us to ask ourselves the kind of  life that you have chosen to live today  is this life that you have chosen to  lift is it really bringing you happiness  joy peace and contentment if this life  that you are living is not bringing you  peace and contentment then you have  chosen death you have chosen  curses so we have to be honest and ask  ourselves what we really choose at the  end of the day how is it that we want to  choose life we end up by choosing death  the answer is simple because most of us  are ignorant most of us in the world we  do not even know what is truly lived for  many people life means to have plenty of  pleasure money power famed  to satisfy all the  desires sexual desires and all kinds of desires  in life and they think they can bring us  happiness  a person who is filled with lust lots of  the people come it's all kind of sexual  crimes live a promiscuous life live an  adulterous life he's a cheater he cursed  people he gets angry with people and he  thinks he is happy in life the truth is  a person who lived this kind of life he  might have what he wants but there is no  real happiness and that is why we are  ignorant and the reason why we inner in  precisely is because we are living in a  world of moral that the relativism in  this world it is hard to tell what is  right and what is wrong anymore today we  have so many different views of life so  many options the world is offering us  green or die's in the social media ternet  most of us are confused because  the way the world presents  what is life seems to be attractive and  it is seductive and so many of us fall  into the illusions that the world  presenter is and that is why it is good  for us to ask ourselves honestly in what  the world is telling us is the way to  happiness in life then we must ask what  is the state of this world today if this  is the world that we are called to live  why is there more division why is our  family breaking apart why is there  increase of promiscuity why is there a destruction of ecology climate warming  society breaking apart so although we  have me progress in science in  technology we have even put on our life  a little bit more but have we become  happier people so most of us we have  been deceived by the world because were  ignorant that is why Jesus when he was  hanging on the cross he said Father  forgive them for they know not what they  are doing so the first reason is  ignorance we do not know what is right  what is wrong so we become pragmatic we  make decisions based on a personal  preference but later on we pay for the  consequences of our foolish decisions  the second reason is because we are  insecure we are not too sure of  ourselves we are not too sure of our  future so why do we grab why do we need  to have more why do we want everybody to  know about this we are insecure we want  affirmation we one loved one security  but you know in this world there is no  real security this world life is  unpredictable  that is a fact of life and so that is  why we are constantly the human person  is insecure and the more he is insecure  the more he grabs he wants everything he  doesn't care about people and most of  all the greatest insecurity of the  modern men today is that he has no life  after death because of second reason  he's reduced to a materialist you need  live for this life there is no other  life those people do not believe in a  life hereafter they have only this life  to deform and so if there is only this  life then we better leave to enjoy as  much as we can because you only live  once so that is the reason why today if  you really want to leave  the fullness of life today Moses gave us the  key if you want to live like he said  then what must you do love the Lord your  God obeying his voice clinging to him  for in this your life consists so  to find happiness in life really means to  put God first and foremost in our life  to love the Lord your God  with all your heart with all your soul with all your  strength this is what is required if you  put God is a center of your life  everything where finds is placed when  God is not the center of your life you  take the place of God you have to run  your own life you have to manage your  own life and you cannot so to love the  Lord your God with all your heart before  your soul is impossible of course unless  you're first loved by God and that is  why again Moses to other people  live in the love of the Lord your God to live in  the love of the Lord your God is to live  in his embraced the reason why we are insecure is precisely because many of us  we have not found security in God it's  just a little job when the parents are  around with the parents are loving the  child will find security so if you love  God and God is your security then this  is where you find confidence in life so  the love the Lord your God means that we  first must encounter him and his love so  with Moses to the people to love the  Lord your God it is because they have  seen how much God has loved them  God has liberate them from eg they were  nobody and God chose them to be his  people live in the love of the Lord your  God do you do that every day  can you feel his love surrounding  you every moment in your life or have you  been oblivious to live in the love of  the Lord your God means to say therefore  we want to also please him so   say you love your parents you want  to live in a love of your parents yes  your parents have loved you    also want to please them so  that is what it means to live in the  love of the Lord so we want to make God  also feel that we loved him and to love  him therefore means to obey His  commandments  again the commandments are not something  that are negative many of us we always  think the commandments they are  inhibitions  they are measures that prevent us from  living in fact in this world today in  the world of moral relativism where we  are not to clear what is right in what  is wrong then all the moon we must turn  to God the commandments are clear the  principles of life are clear it is  revealed by God and so if we truly  believe in God  we will follow his Commandments even  sometimes we don't understand because we  are ignorant and so if we follow the  commandments guess our parents tells us  what to do when we are young and we obey because we know they know best so   this  is required of us and so my dear  brothers and sisters let us pray that  during this season of Lent for us to  find life to the fullest  let us cling on to him let us hear his  voice not just obey his voice but to hear means  to be  connected with him again the Bible tells  us if today you hear the voice of the Lord do not harden your hearts
