 so all of us we are called to purify

 ourselves in loved our whole life on

 earth is always a purification of loved

 for loved ones for our spouse for

 children for God and for church most of

 the love that we have they are

 conditional love and therefore they are

 not completely like the love of Jesus

 this is something we need to recognize

 we should not deceive ourselves into

 thinking that our love is always that

 pure and that is why it is important for

 us when we are prayerful then we will

 examine our own conscience and to be

 able to seep up the motives in what we

 do in life very few of us would be able

 to love without being loved in return we

 expect something

 so the real cross or the real love in

 life always entails self-sacrifice and

 things loved always putting others

 before ourselves and that kind of love

 of course it's extremely difficult but

 precisely we are told that Jesus in the

 first reading in the first reading he is

 the ransom I was paid to free us so how

 then can we love like Jesus and even for

 the Apostles it took them time you know

 that is quite interesting huh

 to take note that when Jesus before he

 died the James and John endure the other

 ten disciples they were still very

 focused on what is worthy but after the

 death of Jesus in notice they were then

 ready to die for Jesus after his death

 they were no longer sitting for glory

 and power in fact they were ready to

 drink the cup they were ready to stand

 up for Jesus suffered humiliation

 martyrdom exalt so what changed them

 from being self-centered to God centered

 what changed them precisely was because

 they were grateful to Jesus so this

 encounter with Jesus love that is for me

 the basis the basis of Christian service

 presupposes that you have encountered

 Jesus loved so great for people are

 those who will learn to love what we

 call unconditionally grateful people are

 those who are able to love from their

 heart and so this is where we are

 reminded that to contemplate on the

 blood of the Lamb that is Christ himself

 who has given his life for us so that is

 why the secret of Christian service is

 always the Eucharist because the

 Eucharist is always a contemplation of

 the love of Christ and secondly the same

 process it is important to be purified

 by the Word of God so that is why not

 Easter these are the two areas the two

 keys to growing up the Eucharist and the

 Word of God to be purified if you have

 the Word of God the Eucharist these are

 the two you can say instruments on which

 in which will be purified in love and so

 let us pray that our love will grow more

 and more each day so that we too can

 serve like Jesus so that like Jesus we

 come not to be served but to serve and

 to give our life as ransom for many
