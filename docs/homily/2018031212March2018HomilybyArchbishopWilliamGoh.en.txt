 my dear brothers and sisters without

 hope it is very difficult for us to

 sustain ourselves without a dream it is

 very difficult for us to move forward we

 all live in hope and always with a dream

 before us we need to have failed in

 Jesus Jesus is the reason for hope for

 dreaming for the new life ahead of us

 and that is why in today's Gospel we

 have Jesus we are told that he is the

 life giver he has come to give us new

 life the fulfillment of the dream of

 prophet Isaiah but the Israelites in

 exile but in order for this dream to

 come true the question is do we have

 bathed everyone Jesus to transform our

 life we need to have faith in Jesus said

 this is true if we have no faith in our

 leaders then whatever the leaders say

 will not transform us will not change us

 so if you want Jesus to transform you

 you need to have failed the question

 that we need to ask ourselves today is

 are you perfecting your faith all of you

 who are here definitely must have faith

 that if not you will be sitting here you

 have failed but you need to perfect to

 strengthen your faith in Jesus because

 for many of us our faith they are on

 different degrees some of you your faith

 is based on fear some of you based on

 the gal ISM some of you based on pride

 but the field that is the mandate of us

 is this total faith in Jesus do you have

 them trust him how do you perfect your

 faith in the Lord whether in terms of

 world in terms of family life in terms

 of relationship in terms of prayer so

 that the spring that our field would be

 perfected like that of the court of fish
