 the purpose Olaf teaches that we must be

 open to the mystery of God's grace

 everything disgrace to be it's not for

 us to determine we can cooperate the

 grace of God that's all we cannot

 control grace you know but it doesn't

 mean to say therefore we can do nothing

 it's to rest the transform if after

 estimate use of the opportunities that

 are available so the problem is not with

 the ground the seat is sold that this

 grace is even the ground

 Vestas how we make use of the grace that

 has been given to us will determine

 whether we are happy if not you can be

 born of the action there are many people

 who volunteer today they are very

 successful because they were born in the

 age they were born marginalized but the

 truth that situation they learn to

 sympathize with others and they write

 out we can be born on what we call the

 rocky past where life is difficult it is

 through this rocky passion like the

 trials the difficulties we go through us

 the balance that we can also write up

 not to be a person that we have today

 so any other day it is not the question

 of the soil or cooperation with His

 grace I think this is where it's

 important for us to whoever they are

 wherever we are whether you're born

 three years ago be born tomorrow I think

 it's important for us to treasure what

 we have and to look at every obstacle

 so it's how we make use of our by I will

 seize the opportunity I think it's

 question of seizing opportunity is a

 melting complaining because we are going

 over complaining lamenting will not do

 it anybody makers angry and there's of

  others self-pity resentful that is not the way

 so we are called trusting for the

 surrender life to you and talk about

 this and we can be happy so happiness is

 area today

 I mean honestly happiness is dependent

 on what you have who you are

 happiness is dependent on your own

 perspective in life happiness is Paran

 on how you look at life and how your

 self red light
