We are called to be mentors for different sets of people. It is not enough to believe in the right doctrines, but more importantly,
you need to make yourself an example to these people, of doing good. So it is actually not just teaching the right thing. It is more important to set good examples. Older people who have gone through many years of life and wisdom, they are supposed to be able to see things from distant and to be able to be more prudent in judgement. That is why it is always good when we are young, always good to seek the elderly for advice and for wisdom, because of their experience in life. So all of us,

whether we like it or not, whether we are conscious or not, we are setting examples for others to follow. And we must remember this - we are all called to be mentors for one another. As a leader, we are called to set examples, so that others too can learn from us and later on when they assume leadership,
all these values will be imbibed in them.

At the end of the day, we are called simply to serve. And to serve, itself is already a great joy. And so, let us pray that we will be ready to be servants of God through mentoring others.
