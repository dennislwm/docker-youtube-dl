 so my dear friends last Sunday we sell

 with the Feast of the Good Shepherd and

 we are told that Jesus is our Shepherd

 our leader in salvation yesterday the

 gospel tells us that Jesus is not only

 the Good Shepherd he is the gate to the

 ship for anyone who wants to find

 fullness of life therefore must follow

 Jesus because Jesus showed us the gate

 that is why we say needs the way the

 truth and life and today again in the

 gospel we are taught Jesus has come to

 give us eternal life a life that is

 lived with God and in God and only Jesus

 can witness the fullness of life why

 because he and the father I want only

 Christ who is in the bosom of the Father

 and show us the time it is for this

 reason therefore if we want to find

 fullness of life then Jesus is our

 Shepherd and the gate the question that

 is asked of us today is this is Jesus

 really our Shepherd is he really the

 gate that we want to enter are we like

 the Jews in today's Gospel they pretend

 to want to know about Jesus but they

 don't really believed in him

 and that is what Jesus says you do not

 believe because there are no shift of

 mine so if you say Jesus is the Shepherd

 then it means that we are sheep what

 does the ship-to-ship therefore jesus

 said listen to his voice listen and

 follow and the true business although we

 see Jesus is

 Shepard many of us we do not really

 behave like sheep most of the time will

 behave like shepherds we think Nia

 Shepherd we want to behave exactly so

 say Jesus a Good Shepherd and we tell

 Jesus what to do we want to listen to

 our own voice not the voice of the

 shepherd we listen to ourselves we want

 to have things our way not the way of

 the Good Shepherd every decision that we

 make it because of Jesus or we'll just

 consult ourselves acting I have all the

  answers so to be sure that means to say

 therefore we listen to the chatter so

 the first thing we need to assess have

 we really listened to Jesus solution in

 order to qualify yourself a shift but to

 listen Good Shepherd requires docility

  attentiveness that is very

 but it's not enough it is not enough

 this ask this question not only we want

 to be suffered instead of sheep the

 other danger is that our real Shepherd

 unfortunately is not Christ interview us

 all our classes how many cases really

 search the scripture spend time in

 prayer when they have an important

 decision to make all these decisions

 where they family life in the office

 do you really consult the Lord and say

 is this your will is this the way to go

 is this based on the gospel values most

 of the time our Shepherd is not Jesus is

 the world this world is our Shepherd we

 consulted media we consult everybody

 else but we never consult Jesus Jesus is

 our Shepherd but we all want to be

 shepherds of others when we ourselves

 are lost when we ourselves are confused

 how can you meet a shift to others if

 you have first not be a sheep this the

 end the day everybody's caught to be a

 shepherd but rapid after the heart of

 Christ not just a shepherd after the

 heart of Christ it is not a lot of price

 then you can become a shepherd

 otherwise you should disqualify yourself

 if you are shattered not after the heart

 of Christ you would destroy all those

 under your care this is true at every

 level not just for priests not just for

 Bishop leaders in corporate world and as

 parents so the question is why is it

 that we are not listening to the

  Shepherd why is he

 we don't follow me because Jesus says

 you do not believe is a simple as that

 we do not believe miss you don't trust

 me when do you listen to someone you

 only listen to people whom you trust if

 people you do not trust you do not be

 you don't listen that's fine when we are

 angry with someone or a stranger comes

 we do not know and you get resolved no

 in a heart shape of laughter so in order

 to believe you need to know and that's

 why Jesus saying you do not know me you

 do not know me

 that's why you don't trust me and

 because it'll trust me very listen it's

 a simple as that

 this reason why relationship if Jesus is

 what is critical critical that is the

 key to trusting the belief and this is

 true even in human life this is

 inevitable that is the reason why I say

 in whatever we do we need to place

 relationships before work

 relationships before committees you

 parents cannot command the respect of

 your children on your spouse or the

 matter if there is no relationship

 because they don't trust you but if you

 have a personal relationship with them

 that there is intimacy if there is

 neutral knowing and loving then even

 though I might agree with you but I will

 so to speak because I trust in you I

 will follow you we don't have to

 understand in order to believed it's a

 matter of the heart and if you trust

 someone even we don't understand we were

 followed a bit because in trusting what

 you can understand will be proven in the

  experiences and that's what Jesus said into this

 gospel I give them eternal life they

 will never be lost no one will ever

 steal them from me

 provided we discern the Good Shepherd

 so basically we are saved but the moment

 we stop listening to him then you will

 be stolen by the world

 you'll be like the stream

 and so come back good question all of us

 we are caught to be shepherds willing

 myself but remember this

 we cannot be shepherds until we have

 listened this way the greater

 responsibility we have in life the more

 time you must pray and most of all is

 the love to pray is to love when we love

 the experience cos the we kept the

 capacity so this is the secret and this

 secret I share with you all

 you must you cannot say you have no time

 for prayer

 you cannot say you're looking for

 intimacy with the Lord because if you

 don't who will suffer your marriage will

 suffer your family suffer suffer your

 work myself so the one hour that you

 sacrifice for the Lord is there will

 help you to be much happier much white

 piece and I tell it as a leader if there

 is no peace you can't give peace to us

 if there is no joy in your heart you

 can't give joy to others you can't do

 that you have fun God so there's no move

 your priorities no your priorities don't

 think that prayer is the least important

 thing for it's the most important thing

 if you have that I can tell you there

 were problems that we trust you are at

 peace
