Discernment of leaders for the Church must always take place in the context of prayer. It cannot be just a logical conclusion.

When we are talking about mission, when we are talking about preaching the Gospel,

spreading the good news, we require more than professional expertise. What is required is actually a person who is passionate about the Gospel, a person who is in love with Jesus. Without these qualifications, the person can be professionally qualified and yet not suitable for the mission. To be in the mission, we need to be friends of Jesus,
we need to be intimate with Jesus, we need to fall in love with Jesus, then we can be in the mission. At the end of day, it is the Lord who calls. It is the Lord who chooses. How can you talk about Jesus to people,

how can you proclaim Jesus, unless we have been witnesses to the Resurrection. And to be a witness to the Resurrection is not just only proclaiming Jesus. A witness means to say, in our own lives we are called to be a witness. And this is where we give people hope, but we need to encounter the Resurrection in our own life.
