 to enter the kingdom of God requires

 authentic motives otherwise we will not

 be able to find happiness

 Pope Francis often wonders of spiritual

 world inist what the world seek for can

 be transferred analogously in a real way

 as well to the spiritual world the one

 power we want control be one recognition

 we want people to appreciate us we want

 to be popular so whether it is in the

 political in the corporate world in the

 spiritual world the sins of man the

 temptations of men are no different that

 is why today in the gospel Jesus makes

 it clear if that is your motive then you

 get what you ask

 jesus said I tell you suddenly they have

 had their reward so if you put your good

 deeds we are not enjoying what we are

 doing so that is what you get same thing

 too if you pray in one people to watch

 your praying then you will never enjoy

 the gif of intimacy with God it's

 important therefore the question of

  motive so if you are looking for power looking

 for glory you get what you want but it

 will not bring happiness power will only

 enslaved you make you insecure and many

 enemies you can't make your money but

 again you don't know what your true

 friends and so it's important therefore

 that whatever we do let us be clear on

 what is not for the service of God for

 the service of men by so doing this is

 where we find deep joy deep fulfillment

 at the end the day actually happiness is

 a question of fulfillment happiness is

 so few that we have make a difference in

 lives of others we have brought some joy

 some meaning some hope don't get

 discouraged when things are difficult

 because the Lord will try them in the

 end now so just surrender everything to

 the Lord amen
