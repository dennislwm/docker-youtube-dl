 on the second week of Easter the Church

 invites us to reflect on the sacrament

 of baptism and we know that Easter gives

 us new life and this new life is evil to

 us through baptism the Christian

 community is called to be one in heart

 and mind and not only that the Christian

 community they are called to testify to

 the resurrection of the Lord so to be

 baptized really is to receive the Holy

 Spirit so that we can have one spirit in

 common so that we can together live in

 love in unity at the same time be

 witnessing people baptism is the entry

 to the Christian faith and the near

 baptized we receive the Holy Spirit the

 Holy Spirit is what helps us to

 recognize Jesus without the Holy Spirit

 we will never know who Jesus is without

 the Holy Spirit we cannot encounter his

 resurrection is the Holy Spirit that

 gives us the eyes of faith through the

 Holy Spirit is the one that helps us to

 enlighten our minds convict in our

 hearts that jesus is risen and Jesus is

 Lord only the Holy Spirit can move the

 hearts of people so the word of healing

 today you know everything that we do we

 know that it is the Holy Spirit and in

 verses we are just learning instruments

 is the Lord who helps us a lot of

 changes like when this is where again we

 see that the transformation of life at

 the end today again is the work of the

 Holy Spirit so the greater the

 conversion so the greater the Book of

 the Holy Spirit so the question is how

 can the Holy Spirit uses it depends on

 that docility it depends on how much we

 want the Holy Spirit to work in our

 lives and this is where baptism in vices

 ready to continue to die to ourselves

 and we were baptized and this is an

 ongoing conversion so that we can truly

 proclaim that Jesus is our Lord
