 today we have the second pillar of the

 lantern exercises which is the team on

 prayer and it is important that when we

 pray as Jesus reminds us to not babble

 as the pagans do for they think that by

 using many words they will make

 themselves heard it is not how many

 times we pray how much we pray but the

 depth of breath so the whole purpose of

 prayer is to unite ourselves with the

 heart of God the Lord Spray is a

 beautiful prayer not because it is a

 summary of all the petitions but it

 gives us the principles of prayer every

 prayer somehow must be reflective of the

 Lord's Prayer so the lost prayer begins

 by saying our Father in Heaven it is

 most important when you pray we are not

 just praying to an empty space God is

 our Heavenly Father and it is this

 experience of fatherhood and because he

 is the father we can be certain that he

 would provide us what we need

 we all say our Father because we are all

 brothers and sisters so every prayer

 that we pray must always include others

 the second principle mere name he held

 holy ID on the blade whatever you want

 to do is to glorify God the glorified

 God is to share in God's glory how can

 we share God's glory by being glorified

 ourselves when we live a life that is

 reflective of his life when you weigh a

 lot the life of Christ who shrine to us

 we become the glory of God and to

 glorify God is simply to let his kingdom

 come and this will be done to a lot of

 God to enter into our life and so doing

 his will on earth is what brings us

 peace the next thing we pray for is our

 daily bread that means to say therefore

 believe in divine providence which means

 to say we just pray for what we need the

 Lord will provide us this bread that we

 asked for is of course not just our food

 the bread we asked for is the bread of

 tomorrow and that is the Eucharist and

 finally eveness is very important most

 of the misery in life most unhappiness

 comes because we cannot let go

 we cannot forgive harboring grudges in

 our heart is a cause of all our paying

 an extra burden you all must always pray

 for the gift of letting go so these are

 the basic principles of what a prayer

 should be any pray compose you should

 have all these five principles to guide

 us
