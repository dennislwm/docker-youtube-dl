 very often when we think of this piece

 of the ascension we are very much

 influenced by the writings of st.</c> Luke

 especially from the ex to the forces

 where we have Jesus in a special manner

 rising up to the sky and then vanished

 from the face of the earth so we would

 think that the sanction of Jesus going

 up to heaven and heaven is up there but

 we know heaven is not up there is just

 an empty space and so it's very

 important for us when he served a Feast

 of the Ascension this image of Jesus

 going up into the heavens it is a

 beautiful image not to say that the

 image is redundant because in this image

 we have Jesus going up to the heavens in

 other words to be glorified so we always

 think of someone being lifted up and

 being glorified and Jesus received a

 full notification of his body and that

 is the goal of every human person what

 is all good in life our green life is

 that we two were sharing the

 resurrection of Christ our do in life is

 that one day we too will share in his

 glory that is the final full of every

 human person and that is where we truly

 belong we do not just wonder in this

 world as if we are going nowhere a

 Christian faith basically is

 fundamentally faith that we will share

 in the resurrection of Jesus and not

 just the resurrection but also share in

 his life and that is what we said at the

 very beginning of the mask when when the

 opening prayer we say that the Ascension

 of Christ your son is our exhortation

 where the head has gone before in glory

 the body is formed

 to follow in hold that is why the piece

 de sanction is a very important phase

 that is the day of obligation

 Thursday is that their ascension because

 it's the 40th day again it is important

 for us to take note 40th day is just a

 symbolic number again because as I've

 said we are so much influenced by st.</c>


Luke's narration of the Ascension in

 actually the process we begin to think

 that Jesus rose from the dead and then

 40 days he was wandering on this earth

 after 40 days he went up into heaven and

 ten days later he sent us the Holy

 Spirit but that is not the real case

 that this is same looks way to

 categorize us who help us to appreciate

 the threefold event of Easter Easter

 actually is a series of three continuous

 event is a continuum actually so

 actually what we have in the gospel in

 the other Gospels even in st.</c> Luke's

 Gospel don't talk about Saint John in

 all the Gospels be of Jesus who rose up

 who rose early in the morning and he had

 the holy women who went to see Jesus in

 the tomb we are told and I remember Mary

 Magdalene because Mary Magdalene was

 clinging to the earthly Jesus and the

 one who let him go for Jesus so he said

 please let me go I must first ascend to

 the Father then I will come back so Mary

 Magdalene so in the evening we are to

 the same evening Jesus appeared to the

 disciples and gave them the Holy Spirit

 which means to say therefore he has

 already gone up to heaven if not he

 could not have sent the Holy Spirit

 this way is indulge gospel the

 resurrection the Ascension and Pentecost

 all happened

 within the same day from morning to

 evening so sing say look however for the

 purpose of catechesis has extended this

 to 40 days plus 10 more days 50th day

 that is Pentecost why in order to

 prepare the church for this long journey

 in life it was important for st.</c> Luke

 because he was writing this part two of

 the gospel which is called exterior

 forces and exit the forces gave an

 account of the history of the church how

 the church was going to move forward

 after the resurrection and it would be a

 long journey and that is why the 40 days

 was a symbol of that long journey

 remember Moses went up to the mountain

 40 days to receive the Ten Commandments

 the laws and after 40 days is a very

 symbolic symbol again because we know

 that on the fiftieth day the new law was

 given that is the Holy Spirit and then

 we have Elijah remember he fasted he

 went to Mount Horeb 40 days Jesus was in

 desert fasted 40 days so the word 40 is

 a symbolic number it's a long journey

 and we need precisely to be prepared for

 this long journey so for those of us who

 are younger journey is longer and for

 those who are nearer to God

 journey is shorter but all of us have

 this long journey to take alive and so

 this is where we need to find courage we

 need to find strength and it's also

 important therefore that it is down

 journey the Feast of the Ascension

 reminds that Jesus is always with us

 again we are so much influenced by the

 special image of Jesus went up to heaven

 and then unlike the Apostles in today's

 first reading they were still staring

 into the sky when suddenly two men

 white was standing near them and I said

 why are you looking up into heaven and

 angel told them Jesus who has been taken

 up from you into heaven this same Jesus

 would come back in the same way as you

 have seen him who they know but Jesus

 was not going away

 but of course the Feast of the Ascension

 also wants to demarcate that there was a

 time when the resurrected Lord to no

 longer be seen visibly by the Apostles

 and the disciples but it does not mean

 to say just because we cannot see him

 physically he is no longer present in

 fact he is present now even in a greater

 way more intensely in a new way so we

 must therefore be careful not to think

 that the Feast of the Ascension means to

 say non Jesus has gone up to heaven and

 we poor orphans are left behind and he

 is up there enjoying himself in the

 abundance that is not the case it was so

 actually until Vatican 2 until you know

 I was ordained in 1985 when I was a

 young priest until 1989 after 1980 even

 1985 whenever celebrating is the mass

 after ascension after the homeland after

 the gospel rudder is read the Paschal

 candle symbol the presence of crisis

 taken away by the author server put it

 in the sacristy to symbolize Jesus is no

 more present now is notice the church

 says the Easter candle will stay until

 Pentecost after Pentecost then we take

 away the Paschal candle included a

 baptismal font so to help us to forget

 to underscore that Easter is a three

 full event and Jesus is going to be

 present because

 in a new way how in the Holy Spirit and

 so this is what Jesus meant therefore he

 told the disciples you know do not go

 out and preach the eight do not go out

 until you receive the Holy Spirit so the

 Holy Spirit is the new way in which

 Jesus is not present with us so he is

 not going away

 in fact Jesus when he said you know I'm

 going to my father's house and have many

 rooms don't think there are many rooms

 and we have to make room for Jesus

 anyone who allow the spirit to live in

 him already has a foretaste of heaven

 heaven enough anyway something when you

 die are you agree to up there here now

 somehow heaven is weary of parties if

 you are happy now if you're at peace you

 already have a foretaste of heaven when

 it's time for us to depart from this

  world heaven is before so long as we are

 people who are freed from anger we are

 detached from the world if we are one

 with God will be a piece of ourselves if

 you have been reconciled we are in

 heaven so the Holy Spirit therefore is

 with us anyone who has the Holy Spirit

 has the foretaste of heaven so we don't

 have to go anywhere so as I have said

 you know on this earth now some of you I

 inferred the trees are in nearly fully

 in heaven in heaven fall it'll come down

 to purgatory most of us and further tree

 all the time but in terms in different

 intensity as some purgatory a very cool

 nur some a little bit hotter but it all

 depends on how much we

 available to the Spirit of God and this

 is possible only because again we are

 very much reminded that you know Jesus

 is the head of the church we are the

 body the hip and the body goes together

 you can either hit up stress the body

 down here these will be behavior Jesus

 is part of the church and therefore

 Jesus is very much one because and not

 only that the Feast of the Ascension has

 something else which is very important

 which we forget some differences if the

 resurrection is a glorification of Jesus

 ascension glorification of Jesus think I

 will yourself it twice notice the

 difference resurrection is the

 glorification the body ascension means

 to say Jesus was restored the divine

 powers that he had when before he became

 many and so that is the case so when

 Jesus was seated at the right hand means

 to say now he is destroyed the power of

 God and is this power that he give us

 the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit

 comes with the gives the gifts that he

 gives to each one of us different

 balance different carries um's

 for the building of the kingdom of God

 for the work of mission so that is the

 reason why the food from now until

 Pentecost we pray for the renewal of the

 Holy Spirit in us so that we can be

 partners in that mission and this is

 where we intercede and ask the Lord to

 give us his spirit and that is why Jesus

 told the disciples you shall be

 witnesses to all the nations but before

 you do that wait for the Holy Spirit and

 so from tomorrow onwards we will have

 the novena to the Holy Spirit so that by

 the time when we serve Pentecost then

 this will be more receptive to the Holy

 Spirit that has been given to us and so

 we can be renewed in faith in zeal
