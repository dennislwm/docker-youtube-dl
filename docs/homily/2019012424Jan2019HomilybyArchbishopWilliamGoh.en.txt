A priest, we know, is called to be a bridge between God and man. A priest, therefore,

is one who is chosen to represent God. He is called to be a mediator. He is called to be a bridge. He is called to be an intercessor.
A priest is called to reveal God's mercy and love. We are called uch people's lives,
to heal lives. Not just only priests alone,

but all of us in our own little ways, according to the profession the Lord has given to us.

Those of you who are married, those of you who are single, we have different responsibilities.

But it doesn't exempt us, therefore, to be Christ-like. It doesn't exempt us to fulfill our vocations according to the state of life that we are in. When priests are harsh, when priests lack compassion, when they are not sensitive to the sufferings of others, people feel very hurt. A priest is not just only to be a revealer of God's love and mercy,

but also revealer of truth. He is called to be a leader in spiritual life, in doctrines.

And a priest is not just only a leader, but most of all a witness of love, of truth. At the end of the day, a priest is judged not by what he says, but how he lives. The question is, do we radiate God's presence? When priests are too perfect, they become self-righteous.

They will lack compassion. That's why the Lord chose us, humble and weak priests, so that we will depend on Him, not on ourselves.
So that we are conscious of our sinfulness and so share the weaknesses of the people that we serve. And so instead of, you know,

when we see imperfections in priests and in yourself too, there is no need to condemn.

Only Jesus, the High Priest, is perfect. So we need to pray, we need to ask the Lord for the grace and we need to strive. That is all we need to do.
