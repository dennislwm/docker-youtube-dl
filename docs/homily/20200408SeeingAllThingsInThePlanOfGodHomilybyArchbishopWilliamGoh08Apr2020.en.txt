  what is your reaction after listening do  today's Gospel of this betrayal of Judas  Iscariot one of the 12th my dear  brothers and sisters do you feel sorry  for to dust over you angry with him did  you say to yourself how could he have  betrayed a master after all that Jesus  had done for them after spending three  years day and night walking sleeping  eating listening to him how could these  men betray the Lord what kind of heart  he had all my dear brothers and sisters  when you were listening to these tags  you were asking yourself whom have I  betrayed in my own life betrayus is not  just that of Judas it is also ours in  fact the history of Holy Scripture the  history of salvation is a long history  of betrayers and infidelities beginning  with Adam and Eve betraying the trust of  God when God put them in paradise  and then we have Cain who betrayed Abel  and killed him and then he was followed  by Jacob who betray Esau of his  birthright Rebecca of Isaac King David  betray God and his own army officer whom  he killed because  he had an adulterous affair with his  wife and the other apostles peter in the  rest they also betrayed our Lord they  were no better than Judas and so my dear  brothers and sisters before we judge  Judas that is also remember that we have  betrayed others in our own ways and of  course we have been treated many times  as well again and again we hear so many  stories children betraying their parents  when they grow up for that parents have  done for them the sacrifices that they  have made or the education that have  given to them and yet when the parents  grow old they become elderly and they  are abandoned by their children or  sometimes children are betrayed by their  own parents because of infidelity they  expect a loving family parents that will  protect them instead one of them commits  adultery and a family broken apart some  people also betrayed their children that  they conceived because they abort them  and kill them before they were born  again so many instances of business  partners betraying each other and  friends as well because of love  relationship so my dear brothers and  sisters we are all traitors in our own  ways and it is good for us to remember  this so what are the reasons for us to  betray our loved ones today the  scripture suggests a few reasons  one of the most important reasons why  people betray others is because of greed  we want more we never have enough money  it is said is the root of all evil  if you loved money and there was what  happened to Judas he was a treasurer of  the 12th he wanted money and we are told  in the scriptures he used the money to  spend for himself not for the community  and so he saw Jesus for 30 silver pieces  because he was greedy and greed often  happens and that is the result the  reason why as I have said especially  business partners so often we hear  stories when the other partner because  want to be richer want to have more  money will sell the company secrets and  even the compel selling the leads of  their customers to other competitors and  even in family we are children you know  they are grabbing for the parents  inheritance they manipulate each other  they manipulate their elderly parents  when they cannot think when they are no  more alert all because of money and  money destroys family isn't it true  every time when you go for funeral wake  those who are in bereavement they are  not crying for the death of their  disease of their loved ones they are  inside fighting angry because of  property inheritance so money greed is  one of the reasons of betrayal the other  reason why we betray according to  scriptures is because we want power and  you know we are taught that Judas  actually some scholars suggested that  Judas did not intend to kill Jesus to  betrayed him what he wanted was for  Jesus to fulfill the role that he  thought Jesus was called  the  liberator of Israel from the Romans but  Jesus you know he was a man of  non-violence  he was what today the suffering servant  houses in the first reading for my part  I meet non resistance  neither did I turn away I offered my  back to those who struck me my cheeks to  those who tore at my beard Jesus was a  man of non-violence he did not retaliate  and Judas wanted him to respond so he  taught that by having him arrested Jesus  would fight for his life but as I have  said he did not and Tudor's was hoping  that if Jesus could liberate them from  the Romans you would have a position in  the future Kingdom and again how true  politics exists everywhere not just in  the political world even in family we  have politics in the offices and also  even in church religious leaders  political leaders we all play politics  because we want  to control others we want power for recognition  desiring power itself is not wrong  provided the power that we are asking  for is for the service of the common  good not to extol oneself not to make  oneself you more important than others  but really and truly for the service of  others that is why those of you who are  struggling and aiming aspiring for more  power you must really ask yourself is  this power you are asking for the  service of others humble service  selfless service or is it for your own  glory or your own wealth and so we need  to be careful because Judas he wanted  power and there is a third reason why  again we betray and this could be due to  wanting things our way  self will pride convenience again we are  told Judas he wanted his plans to be  fulfilled he wanted Jesus to act  according to the plans that he had for  Israel but Jesus did not follow his  plans Jesus only followed the plans of  his father Jesus did not submit to Judas  massive manipulation and that's why  Judas plan was a failure and because he  failed he could not forgive himself when  he saw Jesus led away as a prisoner  interrogated sketched cruelly put to  death he was devastated how could his  plans fail so miserably and because he  failed he killed himself he was too  ashamed to look at himself and there  should not be the case we all make  mistakes the biggest mistake of Judas  was that he did not surrender his plan  the gospel and  unlike Jesus he surrendered his plan his  hands into God's hands you know in life  my dear brothers and sisters life is a  mystery we cannot plan everything  many things were unfold when that time  comes we just have to be alert to how  the Lord wants us respond to his plans  rather then determine and expect God to  fulfill our plans this is where  the cross begins when our plans crosses  the plains of God this is where we carry the  cross but if our plans are aligned with  the plains of God there is no cross  there is only joy there is only  acceptance that is why my dear brothers  and sisters even during this kovat 19  been Demick we don't really understand  the plans of God yet we have not  received the full hindsight of what the  Lord is allowing this pandemic to happen  but if we trust in God's plan if we  surrender ourselves to the plan of God  we can be very certain that this  pandemic will do more good than  destruction of humanity in fact this  pandemic I think was saved the majority  the rest of humanity because the Lord  knows as in all houses for those who  loved him he will turn evil into  something good and so we should never be  ashamed of our past of our mistakes if  we have betrayed people we just have to  turn to the Lord and learn from our  mistakes learn from our failures never  to give up hope on ourselves and there  was the case of Peter  unlike Judas  Peter never gave up on himself he  repented he returned to the Lord so let  us be careful don't be a Judas don't  allow Satan to enter into our heart  because the morrow and we read the  gospel of Holy Thursday the Last Supper  Mazda the very beginning we at all you  know when Jesus gave him the bread  it was  a symbol of evil  Judas consumed by ignorance blinded by  his selfishness and pride just like many  of us and we allow evil to overcome tests
