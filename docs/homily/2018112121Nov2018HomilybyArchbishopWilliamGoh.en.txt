Throughout her life, Mary tried to live her life in such a way that everything that she did was consecrated to God. The grace of being dedicated to God itself is a gift from God himself. The grace of God that is given to us is slowly unfolded.

Day after day, year after year, you discover certain things. You learn in the process of fulfilling a vocation, and all the new challenges come in and then you respond accordingly, moment by moment, event by event. That is how you respond to God's call. To live by grace means to say, we walk by faith not by sight.  At each moment, we want to respond generously. At each moment, we want to say yes to God. And the future we don't have to worry. If you are saying yes at each moment, somehow the future will be unfolded. And so to be devoted, to be dedicated to God, requires our cooperation with the grace of God at each moment of our life, and to be dependent on Him. That means to say, "Lord here am I. Use me. Let your grace work in and through me. Whatever I have, Lord, let  me use it for your glory." So it's allowing God's grace to work in and through us. That is what it means to be dedicated to God.
It's not what we are doing for God,

rather how can God do something with us and through us. That is cooperation with His grace. So we pray that like Mary, as we present ourselves to the Lord, that we will be always disposed to His will, disposed to His grace. And always don't hinder the grace of God from working in and through us.
