 how can we justify ourselves before God

 in other words if we were to die tonight

 will you be ready to meet God none of us

 can ever enter into the kingdom of God

 by our own merits alone for as Christine

 how are we justified before God faith in

 Jesus so how does Jesus justify this

 person follows when we look at Jesus we

 see Jesus as the mercy of God God is

 always ever ready there to forgive us he

 knows we are weak and he forgives us his

 death on the cross is a symbol of the

 eternal forgiveness always forgiving and

 secondly Jesus by His resurrection shows

 that death is not the last word hatred

 is not the last word that truth and love

 will be the last word and so we are

 clinging to Jesus death and resurrection

 and through his resurrection to Jesus

 give us the grace through the Holy

 Spirit we will fail but that doesn't

  matter God understands so we will never be

 ready to stand before God but because we

 know that God is all merciful God is

 Orlov he will forgiveness and His grace

 justified us but you must be sincerely

 wanting to live that life so once we are

 sincere those areas when we find

  ourselves incapable the end it is where the dog

 will compensate for our what we call our

 incapacity the grace of God is given to

 rest where through the sacraments

 through the prayers with the word of God

 we can make use of all these sacraments

 these places to be able to live the life

 of Christ
