Many of us, we want to get near to Jesus.
We want to feel Him, we want to encounter Him but sometimes we just feel that He is not around. The first reason why we can't get near to Jesus is simply because of the crowd. The crowd of course refers to society. It is the society values the prevent us from coming to Jesus.

Especially when you live in a very secular society, you don't have any sacred ambience to remind you of the presence of God. So the crowd refers to the secular values of society, the conditioning of society. They think therefore religion again is just another superstitious belief, nothing to do with life. If you know Jesus personally then of course you will be able to come near to Him.
So if you want to come near to Jesus,

the first thing is to read his Word. But if you don't read the Word of God, you can never enter into the mind and into the heart of God. And in reading the Word, we can put it into practice. This is where putting the Word of God into practice help us to see the relevance that God is alive and that the Word is true.
