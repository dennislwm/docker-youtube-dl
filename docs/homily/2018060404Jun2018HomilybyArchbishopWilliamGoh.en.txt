 my dear brothers and sisters we who are

 baptized we have just finished mr.</c> Gordy

 appearing for those who were newly

 baptized at Pentecost and the danger for

 many of these newly baptized and also

 for resort Catholics is that we often

 take our privileged as God's chosen for

 granted we too would like the Israelites

 who were nobody and the Lord has chosen

 us given us this deep faith in him make

 us his sons and daughters but how often

 are we conscious of this dignity

 although we claim to be sons and

 daughters of God our very lives do not

 reflect what it means to be a son and a

 daughter although we say they are

 justified by faith in Christ yet as in

 games we have said our justification is

 not really just defined us because our

 field is not manifested in good works

 and that is why today the second letters

 in Peter we are warned to escape

 corruption in the world that is

 something virtue and that is why we must

 grow in faith by adding goodness to the

 faith understanding the goodness

 self-control patience through devotion

 all these are necessary qualities and so

 it's important for us that we need to

 truly protect our faith protect what the

 Lord is even first and not be complacent

 and what are the means even dress

 firstly we are doing to this gospel that

  Jesus is the Keystone the constant it's good

 to ask ourselves in whatever we do is

 Jesus the cornerstone of our life

 remember jesus said to Peter on this

 rock I will build my church the rock of

 faith in Christ

 Cynthia also tells us coming to the

 Living spoon unless Jesus is the

 cornerstone we will be led astray we

 will be with in faith and secondly Jesus

 in the gospel said have you not read

 this text of Scripture again are we

 growing in faith coming to not a lot

 more and more as in with the customers a

 Catholic who does not pray the scripture

 is impossible to grow in the faith we

 must make time because it is unnecessary

 the Hyatt our spiritual life and thirdly

 we are told to grow in grace and grace

 comes about through the Holy Spirit

 especially the sacraments that we

 celebrate so let us pray that we will

 nurture this faith Apple curving

 intimate and the relationship with the

 Lord when there is no relationship with

 the Lord our relationship with him but

 then call just like any other human

 relationship so that the spray so that

 our favor is strong our love but even

 even stronger





you
