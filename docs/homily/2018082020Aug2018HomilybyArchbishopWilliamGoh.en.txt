Those of us who are well off, we find that something is missing in our life.

There is a certain emptiness. And what is the reason?

Firstly, the lack of love, the wrong motivation in what we do. We can be coming for Mass, we can be observing all the commandments, more out of fear. When there is no love, the commandments are not perfect. We can give money to the poor, and yet we will not find happiness,
because perhaps we are giving out of guilt. We have so much, others have so little, so we give to resolve our guilt issue. So when we do things not out of pure love, this is where the joy is lacking. It becomes a burden. And sometimes if we are not careful, we become self righteous, we become resentful even. What about those of us who really give out of love, and yet this group of people can also experience emptiness. So what else is lacking?

Firstly, if you are not fulfilling the commandments, you will have no peace. If you fulfill the commandments, you will have peace but not necessarily joy. If you have love, you will have peace and joy.
But still something is lacking. What is that? Love for God. Love for our fellow men is still not good enough. It is the love of God. When we love God, we begin to see all things in perspective. When we put God as the centre of our life, then we ask the Lord, "What do you want me to do with my talents, with my time, with my resources?"

And when we do it out of love for God and love for our fellow men, we find great joy,

peace and happiness. And so for the greater good of others, we should be willing to sacrifice ourselves, if that is what the Lord asks of us. Amen.
