There are those who like to emphasise on the importance of keeping the laws. And there is the other group of people that underscore the need for freedom to do what they feel like doing. At one time,
everything was clearly spelled out in terms of what is right and what is wrong.
Those are the absolutist views. There is no grey area. But today, the world is very grey. Everybody says it is neither right, neither wrong. Because of relativism, everything has to be seen in context and therefore we do not know whether it is right,whether it is wrong.

And so, we find that there is a lot of confusion in the world today because we are not too clear which position we should take. Any law that we do without love, that law will not help us.
That law will not help us to grow. It is whether the person is doing it out of love. But when you love, of course no laws are too difficult to do. When you love, you always go beyond the laws. We need to give the Spirit to people. The Spirit of love, the Spirit of wisdom. When people have the spirit of Jesus, then they will be able to fulfill the laws.

And not only fulfill the laws, beyond the laws. Laws can be effective only if there is the Spirit there. Each one of us, we need to cultivate the right spirit. If you have the right spirit you will always be happy.

Cultivating the right spirit, the Spirit of love, then we will be able to see everything in perspective.
