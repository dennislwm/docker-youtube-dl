 my dear brothers and sisters in Christ

 in the gospel today we notice that Jesus

 he was very observant that there was a

 poor Widow that put in two small coins

 into the Treasury

 instead of taking noticed of those who

 gave so much small he took notice of

 this poor Widow who gave in two small

 coins and yet Jesus to his disciples

 that this woman has given more than all

 the others this is a very important

 lesson for us all to pay attention to the amount of generosity the amount of

 giving is not dependent on how much we

 give it depends on the sacrifice that we

 make every given involves a sacrifice

 and many of us we tend to judge in

 external way we think those people who

 give more or do more they're the ones

 who are generous yet generosity is not

 measured by how much we give but how

 much we love we are left with what is

 woman she was left with nothing she gave

 everything and there is the matter of

 generosity you can be reached and you

 can give a lord but still after giving a

 lot you still have plenty with you we

 are not that were after all we're as a

 poor person who gives even the later

 the person has even so much more and

 that is how the Lord judges us sometimes

 we tend to see things as I've said in an

 external way just because a bishop or

 priest or even a prime minister they

 serve the country we tend to give them

 honor but in truth to tell you honestly

 we deserve no more honor than the

 ordinary person because those have been

 given more they've been given position

 they've been given power of influence

 they expect to do more those are given

 talents and money and resources they

 expected to do more and therefore there

 is nothing really the people should be

 really honored those who have given

 everything that they have -</c> these are

 the people that should be honored and if

 the law in vices -</c> they need to gift it

 is not just giving that counts why does

 the Lord asked us to give giving is not

 just to help some people to give is to

 help ourselves principally to give is to

 share in the joy and the love of God

 that is the reason why God gave His only

 Son Forest he gave everything because

 his son is the only Son and Jesus gave

 everything he gave up his life he gave

 up his divinity to share in our humanity

 and if the Lord invites us to give it is

 so that we can enter into the joy of

 giving the joy of loving that's what

 those of you who do not know how to

 share how to give let me tell you you

 are depriving yourself

 all these invitation to share in the

 beautiful joy and love of God the more

 amount of money can buy let me tell you

 a beautiful story is a story mother

 Teresa herself recounted there was once

 this beggar he was a beggar and he spent

 whole day begging for money and he

 collected 29 passe which is just a few

 cents and she presented that little

 amount the mother Teresa a mother Teresa

 looked at the amount of my first of all

 so little can't buy anything with it in

 the first place

 secondly but if she didn't want to

 accept the gift the man will feel so

 insulted of a few said and so mother

 Teresa took the money and she said she

 has never seen so much joy in someone

 before that this beggar felt that she

 has contributed something to the world

 my dear brothers and sisters no one is

 too poor to give even a poor beggar has

 something to give as I've said it's a

 question of how much we are willing to

 give how many of us can be like this

 poor Widow giving until the last sand

 but that is what Jesus did and today the

 first reading from the book of

 Revelation precisely we are told the

 book of Revelation the martyrs give up

 the alive and that is reason why their

 cross chains because they project the

 image of Christ daughter self-emptying

 and so my dear brothers and sisters this

 is the invitation to all of us today if

 we want to share in God's joy then we

 must learn to give a score for this

 grace contemplate on

 what the Lord has given to you and this

 was imposed to the Corinthians when he

 wrote to them that it is more blessed to

 give than to receive

 receiving brings great joy but giving

 brings double joy when you give there is

 a double joy because when you give you

 are happy the person is also happy and

 so that happiness multiplies so let us

 enter into the heart of God and share in

 this joy of giving
