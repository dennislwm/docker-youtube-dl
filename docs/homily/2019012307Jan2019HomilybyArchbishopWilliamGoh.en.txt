All laws are meant to protect the person,
to protect human beings. That is why we have laws. Laws are meant to help us, not to destroy us. A real person is free when he is able to determine his life in such a way that when he lives, he lives to the full. Only that kind of freedom is real freedom. Otherwise,
the freedom of the world is a disguised form of slavery. When you are not able to control yourself, when you are not able to control your passions, then you are a slave, you are not free. All laws must serve the good of the human person. All laws must be life-giving.
All laws must be based on the principle of love. All our moral teachings are based on the fact that the human person is precious.

Life is more important than all the other things. It is not what he can do, it is not whether he is useful, but it's the person who is created in the image and likeness of God. All laws formulated must be for the common good. Which means to say, all the laws that are formulated, is it common for everyone?
Good laws are those laws that help a person to attain true fulfillment, their vocation in life that helps them to be loving, that helps them to be contributing to society and do good. That is a good law.
