 as we continue to separate Christmas our

 reflection continues to be focused on

 the identity of Jesus trying to help us

 to understand what it means for God

 become men in Jesus the process of

 salvation the father reviews himself

 through the son but unless you recognize

 the son is divine you cannot know the

 father but how do you recognize Jesus as

 divine special for us mm is away and

 this is where the Holy Spirit helps us

 recognize Jesus as the Son to be

 anointed with the Holy Spirit is to be

 given the Holy Spirit so that we can

 come to know Jesus as Lord the path of

 the Holy Spirit is to lead us to Jesus

 so that when you come to know Jesus and

 you come to know the father if you find

 a relationship with Jesus is very

 distant the real problem is because you

 are not conscious of the Holy Spirit

 that is new and so if we become more

 conscious of the Holy Spirit then of

 course the Holy Spirit would lead us to

 the fullness of truth and that is why we

 believe that the Holy Spirit is given to

 the whole church not just individuals

 but the church so the S church we are

 always infallible in belief infallible

 in teaching because the Holy Spirit is

 witness if you want to know Jesus deeply

 if you want to deepen your understanding

 of Jesus you need to enter into the

 spirit that's why Jesus says I will send

 you the Holy Spirit he would remind you

 of all that I have told you
