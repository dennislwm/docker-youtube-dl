As Christians, we are called to proclaim the Good News. Ironically, the Good News is seen as bad news by the world. And what is the reason? They do not know what the Church is teaching. They do not know the true reasons for our teachings. They do not know that the Church is actually for promoting the good of society. The teachings of the Church often have been grossly misunderstood, or not understood at all, because they are not properly conveyed.

Today when people speak about love, they think about freedom. Freedom is an abused freedom.

Freedom is for selfishness, for self indulgence.
It's not a freedom for love. That's the reason why the world is not for us, because we are speaking about authentic love, authentic service.

If we truly love and truly believe in freedom and human rights, then we will be concerned for the good of humanity, for the greater good of society. It's not about myself. It is always about society, about the good of humanity. We are not preaching an ideology.

We are not just preaching social justice.
We are preaching the Gospel. And the Gospel brings conversion through the work of the Holy Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit that ultimately brings about conversion. We need to ask the Holy Spirit to enlighten us. We first must understand what we believe, why we believe.
And this can happen only with the help of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will not just only help us in our witnessing. The Holy Spirit will also empower us. He will give us the gifts of fortitude, understanding,

knowledge and truth. We are just instruments.
If we have done our best, the rest we leave to God. Ultimately, it's the Lord who opens the hearts of individuals. If we intend to proclaim the Good News to someone, we need to pray first. We need to pray that the Holy Spirit will give us the right words to say,
and that the Holy Spirit will open the hearts of our listeners. Not by our strength alone,
not by our own capacity. It is the power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
