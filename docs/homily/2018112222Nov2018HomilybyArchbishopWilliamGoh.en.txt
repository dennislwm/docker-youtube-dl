Are we seizing the opportunities? Are we alert to the signs of Christ's coming? Are we alert to the signs that the Lord is giving to us through our friends, through what we read,

through what we do? All those times when we escape, so to speak, punishment. These are all signs of God's patience with us. But if we don'ake them seriously, in the end we will suffer. And this is true especially for the world today. The world is moving in the direction that if not properly handled, humanity will be destroyed, family life will be destroyed.

The world is thinking about their own interests,
their own preferences, their own enjoyment.

It's all this individualistic atttude. But we only see now, we don't see what is going to happen in the future. So let us pray that we will not be shortsighted but seize the opportunity for conversion.
