 Jesus warns us about false prophets who

 come to rest

 disguised as sheep but underneath they

 are wolves we have to be watchful of the

 true prophets and the false prophets in

 our life and Jesus in the gospel makes

 it clear that we can discern by their

 fruit a sound tree cannot bear bad fruit

 nor rotten tree bears good fruit and so

 some of the fruit therefore that we

 should be looking at for leaders who

 served us first and foremost is their

 lifestyle we need to be credible in our

 lifestyle we need to be authentic

 secondly a good leader must also teach

 the right doctrines the right values

 it's not just teaching things that are

 popular that you get the support of

 people I think a good leader is one who

 must be clear of the kind of values that

 we want to even though some of these

 values are not so easy to communicate

 because a good leader does not make

 policies this for today

 he makes policies for the future and

 thirdly a good leader is one who is so

 willing to listen to the Word of God

 asking the Lord what is the best way to

 handle so this is important because that

 is how we should deal with issues a

 reader who is always reacting it's not a

 good leader and he's gonna make more

 mistakes in life the responsible some

 say Lord teach me your statutes with my

 heart not with a hate with your heart

 and so if we do that then we find life

 and so this is where a good leader is

 knowing the mistakes that smoke father's

 at me and serious about observing the

 dose of God and so that is prayer that

 will be a sound tree that produce good

 fruit
