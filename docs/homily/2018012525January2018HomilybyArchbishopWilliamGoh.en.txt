 on this piece of the conversion of

 simple the church also concludes the

 celebration of unity with the conversion

 that is needed today is not just

 conversion in terms of the world in

 terms of spreading the good news there

 is also a need for conversion of the

 hearts of Christians so that we can work

 together to proclaim the one gospel and

 so how can we promote unity the first

 thing we have to bear in mind is the

 importance of sincerity when we are

 sincere in trying to express our own

 encounters with God this is sincerity

 that actually wins people over with our

 sincerity to share our faith without

 trying to impose our faith on others

 without trying to convert people but is

 the sharing of the gift of God's

 encounter in our life we don't argue

 about doctrines because doctrines cannot

 be understood except in the context of a

 religious experience without the

 experience doctrines are empty doctrines

 can change lives unless they truly

 expressed what we believe

 simple began by sharing his own

 conversion experience and that is the

 way we proclaim the good news that is

 the way we how people to understand

 where we are coming from the way that we

 reach out to people is to learn to

 identify with them when we able to

 identify with the struggles of people

 will their healings with their needs

 then we can connect with them then this

 is really what the New Evangelization is

 all about we are brothers and sisters in

 the same family we are all for the same

 purpose and that is why the best way in

 the end for doesn't Christians and

 Catholic Christians who were together is

 to proclaim the good news because there

 is a sign of Christ's presence in our

 myths essentially was a good news Jesus

 loves us Jesus forgive us Jesus is the

 one who severed

 the other day if we are able to give

 meaning and purpose to people's life not

 just for this our battle have life

 hereafter I think we have done a great

 job each one has their own strengths and

 when we draw from each other so that our

 understanding and then come to Jesus and

 grow and be deepened way more each day
