The mysteries of life cannot be answered because our minds are too finite to understand the wisdom and the divine plan of God.

The answers are just only partial answers. When people are asking intellectual theological questions, it is because they are not convinced that God loves them. If you believe that God loves you,

you don't ask all these questions. If you believe that God loves you, he will somehow take care of you. He will allow certain things to happen always for our good. If you love someone then you begin to see the person from the person's perspective. You know, when we don't love someone, we tend to judge the person from our perspective but when you love someone, you get to know the person's heart, you know the person's mind, you know the person's feelings, then you're looking at life not from your perspective but from the perspective of the person that you know. That's why when you love,

you tend to see more. When you love, you tend to understand more. It'o important to learn to get to know our brothers or sisters. Once you know them then you know where they're coming from.

Then there will be less distrust, you'll become less suspicious. Gifts are important.

Gifts help us to encounter tangible love.

Seek for the highest gift and that is the way of love. Whatever in life, we are called to mediate the love of God. And when people experience the love of God through us, in us, their love for God will become more real.
