 the many offers a ministry or in work we

 just want things to be done our way at

 the bottom of it actually when the

 person is willful is pride because we

 want people to think highly of us well

 of us and when we feel rejected

 we get angry we don't want to share we

 don't want to work together we want to

 be exclusive

 it's brings division so when you are

 deeply wounded you will lift up your

 wounds on purpose we bring our wounds

 into the community where we are in the

 rain I mean then that is what community

 life is all about even in the office we

 just have to this is part of growing our

 selves patience and for the other person

 for healing and so many of us because we

 have hurt outside we have heard from the

 past so we bring our wounds wherever we

 go and that is the real problem so

 sometimes people are not happy we are

 happy people not because the people

 themselves because we carry our wounds

 with us and hurts and so we tend to get

 on people and so that is also the reason

 and forgiving heart

 we need to forgive ourselves that is why

 today in the gospel and so beautifully

 the not spread sums up you know what we

 want to say God is the father of all

 when you pray the Lord's Prayer he loves

 everyone everyone is his children he

 loves all that is what we need to pray

 the loss pray secondly the most praised

 top of forgiveness forgiving ourselves

 or giving others this connection if you

 don't forgive then we cannot give the

 kingdom the kingdom cannot be built

 unless yet inclusive is everybody is

 God's children whether they knew him or

 not and we need to forgive

 so let us pray that we after not that

  too purposes of a broad vision and a big

 heart to forgive those where but
