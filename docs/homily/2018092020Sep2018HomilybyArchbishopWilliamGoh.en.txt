The Gospel is summed up in the passion, death and resurrection of the Lord.

This is what we call the "Kerygma".

This is the centrality of the Christian message
- that God sent his Son, Jesus, to die for our sins.

This is what Christianity is all about, that we are saved because of Jesus' death and resurrection.

And Jesus came basically for one thing - to die for our sins.

In other words, Jesus came to reveal to us the Father's love and mercy and His forgiveness.

And that is what salvation is all about.

To be forgiven and most of all to receive the Father's love and mercy.

It's important for us to come to understand the love of God.

The first important thing is we need to recognise our sins.

If you say you have no sin, then Christ is a liar.

That means Christ died in vain.

If we say we have no sin, then we don't need Jesus.

The moment you lose the consciousness of sin,
you don't need a saviour.

So today, we pray that we will be more conscious of our need for salvation of our own sinfulness,

because the more you are conscious, the more you can experience God's love.

Otherwise your experience of God's love is very little because you think you are self sufficient.

But the moment when tragedy strikes or something happens, then you realise that you are nobody in this world.

We are all human beings, we are not gods.

So we pray for this grace.
