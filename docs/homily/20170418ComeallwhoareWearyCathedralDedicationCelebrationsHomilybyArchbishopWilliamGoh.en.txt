 my dear brothers and sisters in Christ

 it is said health is wealth indeed the

 greatest wealth a person can have in

 this life is good health without good

 health no matter what we have no matter

 how much money and possessions we have

 we cannot be happy in life we cannot

 enjoy what we have with a good health

 you can have a comfortable bed but you

 cannot sleep properly without good

 health you cannot see and count the

 money because you are blind and you

 cannot enjoy watching TV

 we don't good have you got plenty of

 money you cannot travel you have to stay

 at home all you can see is the four

 walls every day without good health

 you got plenty of good food but you

 cannot eat because you have high

 cholesterol and so on that is why you

 know my dear brothers and sisters if you

 want to value anything in life it is

 health because with good health you can

 do anything even if you are poor you

 still can live and use you can enjoy

 because you see you can moved about and

 that is why my dear brothers and sisters

 this morning as we come for this

 celebration to pray for the sick it is

 important for us to realize as into the

 scripture readings we are told that

 sickness is not part

 of the plan of God God did not create us

 to be sick God created us to enjoy the

 gifts of creation he great us to enjoy

 life and enjoy his love indeed we are

 told in today's first reading that the

 Lord fashioned man from the earth and he

 gave him authority over living things

 the Lord has given men this authority

 over creation so they can use creative

 gifts of God responsibly for his

 happiness in lived all created things

 are meant to be at the service of men

 provided they are used responsibly the

 question of good stewardship not only

 that we are -</c> we are created in the

 image and likeness of God God shaped for

 them a mouth a panel give them a hard to

 think fill them with knowledge and

 understanding reveal to them good and

 evil we are created to be just less than

 God we have intellect we have will so

 that God is giving us the freedom to

 make choices in life to choose what is

 good to choose what is true morning then

 we are told that God also gave us the

 Covenant in this responsible Sun we are

 told the Lord is faithful to all of us

 the covenant he gives to each one of us

 this relationship that if anyone walks

 the ways of

 Lord they will find life and so my dear

 brothers and sisters it is good for us

 to ask ourselves how did sickness

 enter the world in the Bible it is clear

 because of sindh

 the scene beginning with the scene of

 our first parents when sin enters into

 the world what does it mean it means to

 say therefore we are not using our

 intellect properly God give us a mind to

 think and to be responsible Downers of

 the Internet is a consequence of our sin

 when we can no longer see things clearly

 that's why today in the world many

 people are pragmatists

 and they think that it is the right way

 those are pragmatic therefore will

 choose what is convenient what is

 expedient but they never think of the

 long terms the future the only are

 concerned about here and now how can I

 make the best of it how can I enjoy how

 can I make more money but they fail to

 see the consequences the long-term

 consequences of what they are doing is

 this experience if you want to look

 after the young children when they are

 newly born they want to work hard they

 want to be ambitious even an NT of money

 at the expense of relationship with

 their children their children grew up

 without knowing them without having a

 relationship with them because they were

 never around so you know my dear

 brothers and sisters a darkness of the

 mind will prevent us about leaders into

 youthness-- nor the darkness of the

 Marga the darkness of

 will disorder in the will God give us a

 choice the freedom of choice to make but

 you notice because of sin our will is

 weakened we cannot control our appetite

 we just eat and eat even though we know

 the food is unhealthy for us

 we cannot start we are greedy we want to

 have more and more when we have already

 enough so we know when our will is weak

 we get addicted to all forms of drugs

 drinking excessive smoking and so on and

 you notice a person who gets addicted to

 drugs to alcohol to smoking what will

 happen to you they were destroyed not

 just your body but destroy your mind a

 person who is always drinking cannot

 think straight and still he wants to

 drive bang accident paralyzed for life

 they don't think because they are

 irresponsible when we have the darkness

 of the will this is where we cause

 ourselves to fall into sickness because

 we don't exercise because we are lazy

 God give us a free mind to thing but we

 don't exercise it properly

 that is why simple says the body is the

 temple of the holy spirit you destroy

 the temple God will destroy you

 not so much God will destroy you you

 will destroy yourself that's why it is

 important for us to take good care of

 our health as much as we can to be

 responsible in what we eat a make sure

 we have sufficient sleep there are some

 people do

 skip enough and then you forsake be sure

 can you pray for me I just pray for your

 sanity disorder lord help you to be

 responsible you need to sleep I can pray

 for you a hundred times if you don't

 have sufficient sleep of course you will

 have migraine headache and all kinds of

 illnesses we have to sleep we have to

 exercise but then sometimes unis do not

 simply come from our sins it comes from

 the sins of others now those of us who

 are suffering may not necessarily cause

 of your own foolishness but because the

 sins of people around us you know there

 are many people around this especially

 our loved ones and our office colleagues

 our bosses and causes must stress in

 life looking after the elderly those of

 your caregivers can be a great challenge

 is very demanding of your patience of

 your laughs of your compassion sometimes

 your loved ones at home your children

 your spouse all these can add lots of

 stress in your life and you have very

 different colleagues who are

 irresponsible who engaged in politics in

 gossip or you have a boss that is

 unreasonable all these people caused us

 to fall into depression and make us sick

 because we do not know how to handle all

 these challenges in our life but even if

 not for those people who make a sick

 because of the irresponsibility by those

 people who smoke all those who smoke and

 early in the age 40 50 some of us young

 children will become orphans let's like

 those of you who smoke and so on if you

 taught up your children taught of your

 wife of your husband you drink and you

  drive have you thought of your children and

 you are paralyzed at home but because

 the Lord wants you to join him in his

 redemptive suffering now because of

 nature but simply because you have been

 irresponsible and we suffer the sins on

 account of the sins of honest man dear

 brothers and sisters even with all this

 creation is still with no imperfect

 that's why I suffer encounter that stage

 you get all you suffer that is also part

 and parcel of life that is what we call

 redemptive suffering the time when you

 have to suffer even though you take good

 care of yourself and the Lord allows the

 sickness to take place and jesus said

 many times some sickness are meant to

 glorify God bring glory to him because

 through your sickness those of you who

 are seeking elderly if you suffer

 patiently cheerfully you can inspire all

 those people who are healthy and those

 of you who are sick here let me tell you

 those of us who apparently look healthy

 and more sick than you emotionally six

 very realistic sometimes you look at the

 healthy people who can walk who can

 dance they are full of bitterness anger

 frustration they are sick they are sick

 they are not happy that's why sometimes

 you know we don't treasure our health

 those of you can walk and eat that

 should be the thing to thank on every

 time when I ask people so what is the

 good news today always there any good

  news so nd with them in all good news I see

 no good news you can eat you can see you

 can walk

 is good news there is good news

 but we use our good health for service

 for love and those of you who are sick

 now you share in the sufferings of

 Christ in a cheerful way and I tell you

 you can bring many people to God because

 of your sufferings like the late pope

 john paul ii saint john paul ii through

 his sufferings many were converted

 because he suffered in faith in union

 with the sufferings of christ so my dear

 brothers and sisters nevertheless in

 spite of all this when we are sick we

 don't presume that God is asking us to

 share in His redemptive suffering

 don't become who and say I think I don't

 need healing you know I don't need a

 doctor I think Jesus wants me to die on

 the cross with him hello you die in the

 cross we also have to die in the cross

 you know you'd make other people suffer

 we must be available to the healing

 grace of God and if you want to be

 available then precisely we are taught

 today in the gospel to be like little

 children today the disciples stopped the

 children from coming to Jesus and he

 says let the literature and come to me

 do not stop them and that is the love of

 the father all of us Angus children do

 not stop them don't prevent them from

 coming to the Lord for His healing love

 don't say they have no hope is not for

 us to say it's not for us to judge it is

 the Lord who determines whether a person

 we seek should be heal or to continue to

 share in the sufferings of his crust but

 we need to bring them to Jesus
