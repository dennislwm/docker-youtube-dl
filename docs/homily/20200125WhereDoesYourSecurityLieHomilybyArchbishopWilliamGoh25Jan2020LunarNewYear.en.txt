  so my dear brothers and sisters this

 year we are separating the year of the

 red the red is not very popular among us

 I'm sure you don't like rats in your

 home in your houses because Reds are

 known to bisque Avengers they are dirty

 creatures and perhaps can spread wuhan

 virus as well and the Reds also known to

 be selfish

 they are mean they are thrifty and they

 still but what is the reason why two

 Reds behave that way simply because they

 are fearful that they would not have

 enough for tomorrow because they are

 always running short of food that's why

 Red's do still and the light of heart so

 that tomorrow will be taken care of my

 dear brothers and sisters even if you

 are not born in the year of the red you

 can be a rooster like me or pig or

 whatever it is all of us we behave like

 rats because we -</c> as in today's

 scripture reading we fear tomorrow we

 are always anxious about tomorrow

 whether we will have enough weather we

 will have to good health whether our

 children's need will be attended to and

 so we are full of worries and anxieties

 and that is why today in the gospel

 Jesus said do not worry do not say what

 are we are to eat what we are to drink

 how we are to be clothed my dear

 brothers and sisters do worry about life

 at the end the day is useless because as

 Jesus said also do not worry about

  will take care of itself each

 day has enough trouble of its own in all honesty we all can plan man

 proposes but God disposes this world

 that we live in today is very volatile

 the market is volatile economy is

 volatile the political situation is

 volatile sickness and health

 we are not always within our control

 even death is not within our control so

 life in truth is unpredictable

 no matter how secure you think you are

 tragedy was right things can happen in

 just a matter of days before you know

 what is going on that is the reason why

 st. James letter remind us you know the

 most we should ever say if there's a lot

 swirl which they'll still be alive to do

 this or that at the end of the day it is

 God who is in charge of us God in charge

 of this life we are not all-powerful no

 matter how rich you are and how powerful

 positions you have in life our life is

 extremely fragile anything bad can

 happen to rest and so that is why it is

 important for us also to realize this

 immense purity is not measured in terms

 of wealth in terms of money yes money is

 important prosperity is something that

 we all desire it is not wrong to desire

 prosperity or even to desire money this

 is not wrong because these are the

 blessings of God who desire good health

 is not wrong but it is how we become

  enslaved these that is why again in st.</c> James

 reading and the merchant is saying today

 or tomorrow we are off to this town that

 town we're going to make money here and

 there and he said you never know what

 will happen tomorrow and so it is very

 important for us always leave from this

 perspective that while it is important

 for us to continue to work hard to do

 our best yet money is not the solution

 to everything in life surely we need

 money but you know if money is what

 brings us security and happiness then

 all the richest people in this world

 would be very happy but you know rich

 people poor people those have plenty of

 money those have no money they also

 worry when you tell me who does not

  worry those people who live in high society

 let me tell you the life is very

 complicated very complex you don't

 believe you watched a Korean movie that

 buy one movie Hong Kong movie these are

 all dealing with those people who are

 living a high life and so much politics

 so much the what we call quarrels

 between families property well

 inheritance power manipulation so even

 those who are reached don't think they

 are happy in fact they have plenty of

 worries and they worry about people

 taking away their power they are worried

 about the money

 who is going to take this money who are

 the real friends and there's hope there

 many people like you also a plenty of

 money worried you suddenly if I die and

 I didn't use the money well how can I

 meet God face to face you ask you you

 got 25 million in your bank and you

 never share with others so if you duty

 to do much money also you feel guilty

 because you know you could have shred

 them and you didn't so whether you are

 rich or poor

 we have no peace and so it is important

 therefore today the scripture reading

 reminds us at the end of day God is the

 ultimate that is why I'm happy you are

 here this morning because we need to put

 God the center of our life so that we

 will see live in perspective when there

 is no God

 you have no perspective in life when

 there is no God you only see yourself

 and your needs and your fears and your

 in Zayat ease but when you know that God

 is in charge of this world as the

 response rates and bounces you know

 before the mountains were born on the

 earth the world brought for view our God

 without beginning or end so God is in

 charge of this world we just be Accord

 to trust him to surrender our lives to

 him and that is what Jesus asks us to

 put our trust in him but many of us be

 like trust in God again can understand

 why because many of us as Jesus tells us

 you know it is the pagans who set their

 hearts on all these thing pagans who are

 the pagans pagans are those who do not

 recognize God as their Hamley father

 pagans are orphans in other words they

 do not know God that is why the only

 cling to themselves they cling to their

 wealth they are stateless the power

 thinking that these will give them

 security the security is not placed in

 God that's why Jesus said your Hanley

 father knows you need them all if God is

 your handi father you will know that he

 will provide somehow if he has not

 provided I think you should not be here

 today the fact that he has provided you

 all this here some of your own ideas or

 means God has provided you all this year

 he might not provide your plan

 plenty because he knows you cannot take

 it also he provides you what you need to

 be happy in fact actually we have enough

 very few Singaporeans in Singapore very

 few Singaporeans really you know they

 don't have the basic needs in life basic

 needs I think most of us we have it is a

 better lifestyle that we are looking for

 those of you who are used to what we

 call comfortable life now so after

 retirement you have worried you know

 then I got to downgrade these you know

 maybe I can not do this anymore and that

 is our worry we want to have what we

 call a very comfortable lifestyle but in

 truth what is the best lifestyle that

 one can have the best life that doesn't

 mean go for holidays or the time go

 holidays all the time is the torture no

 every day 365 days a year and holidays

 is almost like you don't have a country

 a migraine all the time going here going

 there life is such a yeah it's terrible

 I will go for holidays all the time

 those of you who got not eaten every day

 do dry swimming a carry bar you exercise

 running your fingers and your greens but

 your body don't exercise so this is very

 important for us so if we want to be

 really happy in life that's why Jesus

 says set your hearts in his kingdom

 first and on his righteousness and all

 others things will be given to you so

 what is righteousness is to be at peace

 with God at peace for brothers and

 sisters who live a responsible life to

 live an honest life I tell you honestly

 even if you just leave the responsible

 life you take care of yourself eat but

 don't eat too much you know eat healthy

 and exercise exercise now follow the

 bishop done every day spend one hour

 doing exercise because if you love God

 if you love the people of God you must

 exercise take care of your health

 you don't expect God after the coming

 father can you please pray over me or

 brave that you will exercise one day

 because you lazy bomb you don't exercise

 you want to have good health cannot

 because the body needs exercise so he

 pity supreme take care of yourself

 good body is the temple of the holy

 spirit you eat reasonably if you want to

 eat everything all that try Korres first

 of all my prayers will not help you

 you know you'll be wasting time every

 other day we've come asking me to pray

 over you so be responsive if you live an

 honest life responsible you'll be happy

 and most of all you know whatever we

 have actually is to reach out to others

 you know money is good is beautiful

 money when used for love

 make friends reaching out to people

 money is a good thing if you use it

 wisely it brings you happiness a joy

 that the world can not give money is

 always for you to make friends who reach

 out to others and I tell you honestly if

 you use your money well the greatest

 happiness in life is joy in your heart

 peace of mind knowing that you have been

 responsible with whatever the dot has

 given to you yes you need to take care

 of yourself we're not asking you to be a

 Widow's mite you know you need to take

 care of yourself

 but we need to reach out because at the

 end of the day let me ask you the truth

 some of you are always worried about

  money how many Singaporeans and when they die

 they are penniless not many most of you

 have plenty in the CPF plenty of cash

 and user and who use them your

 ungrateful children use them out so

 while you're alive why you need to use

 them well control your funds manage your

 funds be responsible doesn't mean to

 trust God we are irresponsible be

 responsible and so this is where it is

 important to know as the sponsor

 sometimes makers know the shortness of

 our life that we may gain wisdom of how

 our life is short we don't have much

  time that's why I'm ready 63 you see I want

 to use as much time as I can to reach

 out to people because after that you

 know that's the time when I retire I

 just have to you know maybe time to go

 back home so better do what you can

 while you see you are healthy while you

 still have the resources that time you

 want to do you cannot do too late too

 late you will regret you know then any

 when you're lying in bed you say a year

 I wasted my life that is true

 I work from you yeah you wasted your

 life because you have not lived your

 life well so today let us celebrate the

 year of the red coast to be a great

 doesn't mean to be bad actually red also

 very good qualities red is very

 delicious and very hard working a full

 of initiative you know where to get the

 food and they like to work at 9:00 at

 night when you are sleeping nearly full

 of initiative and the red is very

 intelligent and not always asked Avenger

 by the way you know if you go to Taiwan

 you go to child those areas they grow

 Patea grow rice they actually have Reds

 in the rice field and the rest are all

 very huge very huge

 that's why red is a symbol of surplus of

 what they call wealth for the Chinese

 because these Reds they eat the rice off

 every fat and they are service delicacy

 no delicacy at the table can be eaten

 Reds are meant to be eaten those in the

 rice field not everywhere not your house

 red don't give me your house Red's a

 place I don't want those from the rice

 field they are very tasty we don't

 believe we got those Cambodia Vietnam

 China and they do all these things so we

 must be like the rat you know eat until

 fat fadna and then give ourselves in

 service to others this is what the

 yukkuri is all about Jesus giving his

 himself his body and blood for others

 and if we are that kind of big fat rat

 so that is used as surplus we have for

 the service of humanity aiming
