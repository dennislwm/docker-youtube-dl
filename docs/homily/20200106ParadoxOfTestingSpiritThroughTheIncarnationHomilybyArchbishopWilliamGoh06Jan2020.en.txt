This world is a very confusing world, where things are volatile, things are changing and life issues have become very complex. We are living in a situation where there is more darkness than light because things are no longer clear. How do we discern the spirit? How do we discern what is truth and what is love?

Because truth and love are used today so freely by everybody. Everything is done in the name of love. And so if you want to really discern what is love, then we need to ask that ultimate question - Is it truly love at the beginning, truly love at the middle and truly love at the end?
If we want to be true to what truth and love is all about, Jesus becomes for us the measure of what true love is. Jesus becomes for us the measure of how do we walk in truth and in love. In this complex world, we ask ourselves, we turn to the Lord. How would He have lived His life? What does the Lord have to say to us with regards to certain issues in life? What are those principles that Jesus has given to us in the Gospel?

And so it is with this, that we walk in the way of love and truth. And it is with this,

that we walk in the light, in compassion,
a source of hope to others. Let us be that light. Let us be that light and hope to people around us. Let us be that light and hope to our friends, our colleagues and our family members. Unless we walk in that light, unless we become the hope for others, then we have not truly lived out Christmas in our lives.
