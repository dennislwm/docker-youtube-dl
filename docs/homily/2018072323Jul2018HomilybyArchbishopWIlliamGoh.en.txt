How do we live our lives? e hand we appear to be good, religious, observing all the rituals, whatever it is, but our lives are not just. Justice is the most important way we worship God. Charity towards our brothers and sisters and Integrity.

That is what pleases God.  The whole purpose of justice is to bring about relationship. If we act justly, if we treat our brothers and sisters well according to what is right. That itself is truly the worship of God.

That is why for us, faith and charity, they always go together. And to love tenderly, which means to say, while we act justly, there is always the question of compassion, the question of forgiveness. When people do wrong because people are weak, because people are tempted,
this is where we must love tenderly. We must be merciful. God desires that we live a just life and desires  that we live a life of compassion and to walk humbly with your God. That is all we have to do. So honestly, if Catholics were just to live a righteous life, treat our brothers and sisters well, treat our workers well, treat our colleagues well, do what you have to do, if you are responsible, that is enough. Let us pray that we will respond to the love of God,
not because we have to, but because of His mercy and love. If we know that what God has done for us, then out of gratitude,

let us live that life because He has given us His grace.
