Sometimes we face tragedies in life. In the face of such tragedy, we begin to wonder - is this God we worship real? Can we continue to trust in Him? It is by the power of God that Jesus was raised from the dead. And so it is this confidence that because the Father raised Jesus from the dead, we will also have the same confidence, that even when we do not understand what is happening in our lives and those tragic events that happen, we need to cling on to the fact that Jesus is risen in our midst. And that's the reason why we must not fear,

we must not allow evil to overcome what is good. We need to be bold in proclaiming the Word of God even when things do not appear to be going the way we want. Unless we have the heart of Jesus, unless we have the spirit of Jesus, we will never be able to understand. Unless we put on the mind of Jesus, unless we have the spirit of Jesus,
we cannot see beyond what is seen with our own eyes. We cannot go beyond what is happening. Only those who have faith,

those of us who are born of the Spirit will be able to transcend every challenge, every trial in life and to be able to see the way how God would turn evil into good, injustices to justice. We need to continue to heal. We need to continue to reach out. We need to continue to show the marvels of God in our life. Even in a world that is cruel, even in a world that is full of division, we need to show the difference. And this cannot be done, my dear brothers and sisters, unless we are filled with the Holy Spirit.

And so this is why when we are baptised in Christ Jesus, we want to put on a new mind to be able to see life the way the Lord Jesus invites us to see. And this is how we will conquer all difficulties and challenges in life.
