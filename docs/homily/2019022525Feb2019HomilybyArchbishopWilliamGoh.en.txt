We must never forget that the devil is real.
Evil is real. And that is the reason why we need to be alert. The trends of the world today, relativism, secularism, they are not promoting the truth. Today, people are advocating a culture of death. Some are inculcating,

promoting a culture of fake love. This is the work of the devil - changing fundamental truths that preserve the bedrock of society.
And it's not easy today because it seems the world is so much against us. And it seems we are losing the battle. Those of us who have faith, we will battle on, because we know at the end of the day, we will win the battle. How do we increase in faith? If we want to increase in faith, we first and foremost must acknowledge that we are weak in faith.
We cannot take spiritual life for granted.

We cannot think that our faith is so strong.
When you realise that you are inadequate in your faith, then you will do something. Then you won't be complacent. And how can the Lord help you? You need to pray. It is only when we start praying, growing timacy with the Lord, reading the Word of God, then we know Jesus, then we have the faith. We must have hope. But to have that hope, you need to strengthen yourselves in prayer even more.

We need to pray, we need to fast, we need to arm ourselves with the Word of God and with the Eucharist and the Sacrament of Reconciliation.
And we will stand firm.
