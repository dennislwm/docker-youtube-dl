The desire of Jesus to have a Church that is united in every way is something for us to continue to strive. What is most important for us Christians and Catholics together, at the end of the day, is that do we believe in the kerygma. And the kerygma is simply the proclamation of Jesus' passion, death and resurrection.

If there is only one doctrine that all must believe in and no compromises, is that we must believe that Jesus died and He rose again. That is the centrality of the Christian faith. If you call yourself a Christian, this is the common doctrine that we hold.
Unless we believe that Jesus died and rose again, we cannot confess the divinity of Christ, that Jesus before the foundation of the world was always one with the Father. So there is no way to say that Jesus is Lord, that Jesus is our Saviour, if you don't believe in Jesus'

resurrection. The implication therefore is that all that Jesus said, all that Jesus taught, we are called to believe. It's the Father's endorsement of Jesus as His personal spokesman. If Jesus did not rise from the dead, there is no reason for us to believe what He said. He could be just misguided. The fact that He has been raised from the dead means therefore He is what He claims to be. And if we Christians make this absolute claim that He is the Lord and Saviour of all humanity, it is simply because we cannot confess in Jesus less than the fact that He is Lord. So today, it's very important for us to maintain faith in the resurrection of Jesus and especially with Christians. We can disagree in many things, but at least what holds us together is to know that we share in the same faith, the same Lord, desire for salvation the resurrection of body, that is what we all believe in, although the way we express it, the way we apply it in our daily life, that might differ. But at least, let us hold onto this kerygma that we hold in common with Christians. And that is our common hope.
