 so my dear brothers and sisters reverent

 sisters especially sister Marilla and

 mrs. beebie end and all of you my dear

 young people we are very happy together

 here this morning to celebrate the

 hundred 65th anniversary of the

 foundation of cij in Singapore and so we

 are full of gratitude and joy for the

 contribution for the education that I do

 sisters have given to so many

 generations of people in this country

 and now they are contributing usefully

 for the service of the nation and the

 church and society my dear friends as we

 gather here this morning it is important

 for us to ask ourselves what are we here

 for the team that you have chosen for

 the celebration is ever seeking and ever

 serving this is truly a very beautiful

 team because to seek and to served there

 are two dimensions of the same reality

 if we seek without serving we will end

 up serving ourselves there are many

 people who are seeking for power for

 positions in life for honor for glory

 for money but is all for themselves

 ultimately they cannot find true

 happiness in life that is why the fruit

 of seeking is always serving when the

  person see he seeks so that he can serve he can

 be of contribution to church society and

 humanity but the question is this

 there are serving comes first or seeking

 comfort seeking and serving are mutually

 dependent on each other in order to

 serve we must know we must first seek we

 must have the resources we must have the

 means to served

 that is why seeking is primary on the

 other hand if we do not know what we are

 serving and who we are serving you do

 not know what you should be seeking in

 other words if you want to build a house

 what do you do first you must get the

 architect to draw the house that is the

 vision you have and from there you start

 to build and construct the building if

 you don't do that along the way you need

 to modify the building and that will

 incur extra cost and so the key is to

 start from the end and from the end we

 we didn't and so what is the end what is

 the energy mission the end of the I J

 mission is simply this to share in the

 dream of the founder of I J sisters

 blessed nikola and what was his dream is

 very important for us because if we are

 in I J we are called to live on and to

 make the dream of your founder a reality

 in our myths do you know the dream of

 your founder I hope so

 if not we need to give them a special

 lesson on this the vision of Blessed Nicola was to help

 all the poor girls especially those in

 poverty to help them to become

 independent to become people who can

 contribute later on to society and bless

 Nicola he knew the key to this world

 that he was called to do he realized

 that the fundamental reason why young

 girls were not able to contribute to

 society was because they lack spiritual

 formation and human formation and that's

 the reason why his philosophy was to

 instruct and to educate the young girls

 and this mission continues with the IG

 and they continue to live out this

 vision of blessed Nicola throughout this

 hundred and sixty-five years of history

 and more the very fact that one of the

 most important mission of the IGA

 sisters is to provide education for

 those who are disadvantaged for those

 who are deprived of opportunities the

 great thing about the IG mission is that

 they realized that they are called to

 serve the marginalized the great thing

 about LJ school is not because we

 produce elite students on the contrary

 the great thing about ng schools is that

 those young people who have no

 opportunities have been given

 the opportunity to grow and to succeed

 in life in fact that is the hallmark of

 Catholic education Catholic education is

 not to make the rich richer I think

 education is to help first and foremost

 those who are poor in studies those who

 are disadvantaged in various ways and

 then when we transform them into leaders

 of tomorrow that is something for us to

 boast about there is something for us to

 be proud of and this is what the IJ

 sisters have done you remember very

 clearly that very beginning at the IJ

 mission in Victoria Street the first

 students were orphans the first students

 were poor students they were given free

 education and that's the reason why

 today many of you we have many unknown

 my students here because they have

 benefited from the spiritual the human

 intellectual formation given to them

 today they have become leaders of

 society and so you know my dear brothers

 and sisters as we gather here this

 morning it is important for us to keep

 on dreaming the vision and the mission

 the present Nikola has given to us and

 how can this be done how can this be

 done only when we subscribed to the four

 core values that I just schools are

 asked to lift out what is it that you

 are supposed to seek in order to be of

 real service you are supposed to seek

 what is the first thing seek truth if

 you do not know the truth

 truth is more than just

 intellectual knowledge technology skills

 truth means to know about ourselves do

 know about our identity our direction in

 life what are you living for what are

 you here for that is the most important

 question we need to ask ourselves if we

 know the purpose of life then we can

 live our life meaningfully that is why

 you are called to seek truth but truth

 is not sufficient we need to seek love

 because the whole meaning of life at the

 end of the day no matter how successful

 you are how great you are how many

 achievements you have made a man a woman

 without love has no meaning in life that

 is right today in the gospel Jesus said

 love one another as I have loved you it

 is only when we begin to laugh begin to

 serve that we find meaning that is why

 the third value that you are called to

 seek truth love and justice why justice

 because justice means not my own rise

 that's the whole problem the word today

 people are saying about mine rise that

 is not justice justice is about the

 rights of everyone that every human

 person created the image and likeness of

 God has this opportunity in life to live

 and to give his or her self for the

 contribution of humanity that is justice

 so justice means right relations and

 finally freedom today you notice freedom

 is abuse freedom today is about oneself

 about my pleasure about what I want to

 do what I'd like to do true freedom is

 not a freedom for so true freedom is the

 capacity to love

 to surf freely freedom is always for the

 service of others and not for ourselves

 so my dear brothers and sisters my dear

 young girls and mostly those of you who

 are here the future of the nation the

 future of our country is dependent on

 you and so we pray that you will

 continue to live this agile spirit and

 truly be faithful to your motto which is

 simple in virtue steadfast in you know

 how to see but you do understand are not

 to be simple in virtue means that first

 in order to be responsible you need to

 be true to yourself you need to grow in

 virtue in 42u in wisdom in truth in

 understanding in love simple in virtue

 so that you can be steadfast in duty

 giving yourself wholeheartedly to

 strengthen to form yourself in such a

 way that you'll be responsible in your

 vocation in life

 this is our prayer for you and we

 continue to praise and thank God

 especially for the sisters and all the

 teachers as well and all the other nice

 students who are here for continuing to

 help those who are still in education to

 grow and to become more and more the

 glory of Christ in them as what we have

 read in today's first reading a mint
