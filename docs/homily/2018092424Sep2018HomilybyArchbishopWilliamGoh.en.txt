How do we live in the presence of the Lord? How can we be conscious that we are always in His presence? First and foremost, we need to be guided by the light of Christ,

to be guided by His Word. We cannot walk in the presence of God unless we are imbued with the Word of God. If the Bible is the Word of God, it must be the point our departure, looking at every issue in life through the eyes of God. The next thing we need to do is to let the Word of God, let the light of Christ shine through us.

We read the Word of God not just for ourselves but so that we can be witness to the truth. Either you are secularised by the world or you evangelise the world. Either you change the world or the world will change you. So if you want to keep your faith,

we need to evangelise. The moment when you share the Word of God, the moment you share your faith, your faith becomes stronger, clearer and more focused . To walk in the presence of God is to live a life of truth and charity. Living a life of justice is how we witness the Gospel of light. Being just to our neighbors,

just to our workers,  just to our friends, just to our responsibilities at home.

Justice is a very important manifestation, so that people can see the presence of God in us. But justice is not enough. We must also exercise charity. We are called to love God and to love our neighbor. So anyone who lives this kind of life, he can say he is a just man and he walks in the presence of the Lord.
