 being a weakness for Christ today is

 extremely challenging for many reasons

 because of the rise of second reason the

 rise of second reason ironically is in

 part due to religious conflicts and

 fundamentalism and secularism is

 actually another form of religion it's a

 vision of beliefs in lifestyle

 it's an unintended consequence by saying

 no to all other religions and a

 bookkeeping secularism is almost

 endorsing that this would be the way of

 life and the result therefore my dear

 brothers and sisters is this because of

 global migration a boon cosmopolitan

 society a society that have many

 religions without a homogeneous

 population plus social media they often

 have fake news missing with

 misrepresentation to fail all these

 things have caused the world to be

 rather divided and also in that sense

 promote secularism and so what we do in

 the face of these challenges in

 witnessing today the gospel makes it

 clear first and foremost several people

 who will not understand this why because

 they never know the father so we must

 accept people will not accept what we

 believed but they're also those people

 who will be thinking that they are

 killing as holy duty precisely because

 there are people who are misguided

 fundamentalist who attacked another

 religion then some Google attackers

 because of sin because they are rice

 wool their best interests

 they are compromised because of what we

 say the best fault witnessing requires

 patience sensitivity no hostility no

 aggressiveness as believers of Christ in

 fact we should be ready to give an

 account powerful

 charity and understanding attacking

 another person's way or even attacking

 those who are non-believers is not the

 way of the gospel it is only when we

 live an authentic Christian life a life

 of love and service that would be the

 ultimate conviction for others that

 truly Christ is our Savior at the end

 the day conversion is not yours or mine

 work it is the work of the Holy Spirit

 if one people to be converted we pray

 for them we pray for ourselves and let

 us live good charitable loving lives

 amen
