People are not happy or satisfied with our priests. Our priests are never good enough for the people of God. The first reason is simply because our laypeople have high expectations of priests. This is understandable because priests are called to be a bridge to God. We are called to be a mediator to Jesus Christ.

We are supposed to project the face of God, the mercy and the love of God and His compassion. And therefore when priests fail to be exemplary in their conduct, in their Christian life,
many of our lay people, they become disillusioned, they are hurt and they are scandalised. Priests are human beings,

they are not gods.
And why does God choose human beings to be his priests, to be his representatives?
So that he can sympathise with those who are ignorant or uncertain. We too are sinners with you. But precisely because we are sinners, because we too struggle against temptations, sometimes we overcome, sometimes we fall, that is the reason why priests are chosen, so that they can have empathy for you, they can be sympathetic, they can be forgiving. A priest must take holiness seriously in his own life. When the priest is no longer pursuing the path of holiness, no matter what he does will all be in vain.

He can be a great preacher, a great organiser, a great administrator, but he is no longer showing the face and the mercy of God. What is the greatest thing you can do to support and to help the priests? To help him grow in holiness!

It is difficult for me to keep my priests to live a life of simplicity and detachment,

so don'empt our priests. Priests should be respected because they are your leaders, but they should not be glorified.
Only God is glorified. Yes, we need to encourage the priests but let us keep our priests humble. We are servant leaders. Authority is given to us, so that we will be the most humble of servants. So let us pray, so that we can keep our minds alert and most of all, to be alert against the temptations of the evil one.
