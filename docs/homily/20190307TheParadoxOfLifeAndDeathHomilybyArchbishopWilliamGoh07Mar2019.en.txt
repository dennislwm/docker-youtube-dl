 for those of us who look for an external

 happiness will expect therefore that if

 we follow the ways of God we should find

 fullness of life along life and of

 course blessings from God it's not how

 long believed but how well we lived it

 is not whether we are prosperous and

 free from suffering but whether the

 sufferings that we bear in life are

 helping us to become more loving people

 more giving people people who live life

 with passion people who live life with

  meaning in fact riches and long life can

 sometimes be a weapon against us riches

 and long life sometimes can also be a

 source of war for us no important is

 whether you have money that they don't

 have whether healthy or whether are you

 living a meaningful life if you want to

 save your life you need to lose it you

 need to give your life for others you

 need to take risks in loving only then

 you can be alive otherwise you can have

 a long life but that life is no real

 meaning if you suffer you become strong

 you are able to withstand all the

 difficulties of life and life is such

 that if you've gone through hard times

 then we are grateful to God and you can

 know you can be happy or in whichever

 situation you are in

 how can you live your life in such a way

 what must you do to really live life if

 you can answer the question then already

 are preparing for the season of Easter

 or the new life
