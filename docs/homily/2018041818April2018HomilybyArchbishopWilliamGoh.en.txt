 so today the scripture readings invite

 us to reflect on the dynamics of changed

 but the truth is that in life no matter

 where belief there were always be

 changes nothing is static in this life

 everything is moving it's very important

 to make adjustment especially as we get

 older children get older everything

 needs adjustment all the time and this

 is very true for the church as well nor

 the church every organization we are

 always changing we see the situation the

 early church today the early church too

 was living a very happy life and we had

 to after the conversion because they

 were live in a small little community

 I love you you love me sharing

 everything they have together they were

 actually very happy here and of course

 the group gets bigger and then the

 Jewish leaders begin to react oh

  goodness this group is getting a bit big and

 becomes a threat to the existence of

 institution then decided persecute in

 there so when he started persecuting

 them this shows where we are toll into

 this was reading they started to spread

 but because they persecuted then they

 had no choice so they they were

 scattered all over Palestine at first

 they were in Jerusalem then they went to

 the Samaria all the other places because

 you take refuge in other places they

 build new communities and that is how

 person 80 grow every time is because of

 changes that force us to see things a

 new way to undertake new challenges and

 to force us to be open to be receptive

 so persecutions and changes in I mean

 they are a nuisance initially it's

 difficult because we are in creatures

 but they are necessary without all these

 things without changes without

 challenges the church will never have

 fruit and this is where today the church

 is constantly being challenged

 in the US the discrimination

 marginalization the church is still

 going on in the world today Christian

 tea is also under sample persecution not

 direct but very subtle in terms of

 values in terms of morality

 so this prosecution is going on soon and

 so this is where it's important for us

 to really ask ourselves what do we do in

 the face of persecution no I won't see

 all these things and negative which is

 very positive

 it forces to rethink how we can sell the

 good news even the more effectively we

 have the English level if you don't

 engage the world you'll be left behind

 and that is what conference is trying to

 do that's English tubule that is dynamic

 the world that is fine listen means to

 help them to understand where they're

 coming from so the question is auto-lock

 she comes first affect pragmatism so

 between the two this is where the

 tension days we do this patter is going

 on we will find a medium along the way

 as two things can happen soon

 but this is where the church continues

 to debate but this is where we will grow

 so the tension in life should not

 discourage just tension is of this part

 of growth so we should not run away from

 tension we should learn to be creative

 to think positively so you need to

 actually try to be one with them to

 understand where they're coming from

 when we talk and we die not we will find

 the right
