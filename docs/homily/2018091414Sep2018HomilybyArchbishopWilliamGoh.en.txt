The cross that we are celebrating is not a cross that destroys us.

It is a cross that liberates us. When we celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross, we are saying that the cross triumphs at the end. The cross triumphs because instead of guilt there is grace. Instead of sin there is love.

Instead of disobedience there is obedience. And so we know, my dear brothers and sisters, as we gather to celebrate this Feast, we also come to celebrate God's love for us in Christ Jesus. The cross is the symbol of divine mercy for the whole world and for humanity. It is by contemplating the cross that we find hope in a world that is full of suffering, full of sins and full of pain. So that's why today as we come to set the Feast of the Holy Cross, we need to cling on to the power and the grace that comes with the cross. And I think is also important in the light of divine mercy shown to us on this Feast of the Holy Cross, again it is good for us to remind ourselves how should we respond to people who have hurt us,

people wo have offended us regardless of whatever crimes that are committed or whatever offenses. We must be careful that we do not fall into the mentality of the world because if we allow evil to overcome good then we have lost the better evil cannot be overcome by  can only be overcome by good we do not use evil to destroy evil true justice must restore the equilibrium true justice is to restore the person who is hurt and the person who has hurt us this is the true meaning of  is really to make things right to restore everything so that there will be peace that we loved that we joy and they'll be forgiveness what the church wants is restoration healing reconciliation and so true justice must seek the good of the person who have hurt us and also to heal those people who have been hurt it doesn't mean to say that we allowed the criminal the offender to go free and continue humming people that is not Christian justice as well Christian justice is to make sure that the offender is prevented from doing more harm Christine justice also demands that we stop the person who is causing others injury others to be hurt when you punish people who have done wrong we make them even more resentful and bitter with the world and bitter with society it's important to take note that those people who are hurting others and those people who hurt others the person that is most hurt besides those whom they have heard is themselves those who continue with evil without evil to destroy them when a person'in he is led to even more sin because sin becomes so to speak the power that enslaved him nobody commits one sin alone and this scene lists of many other scenes it is true with all sins the punishment for sin precisely is to sinned even more the Lord understands how we as sinners are struggling to live an authentic life trying to live the gospel life and yet we fail  we let us be clear all of us are sinners in different degrees in different ways but the Lord loves us and that is why the Lord wants to show us his mercy through his cross metimes you know in life we have the cultural suffering especially if we are the one who have sinned and to accept punishment and suffering graciously as grace of God to heal us as grace of God to help us to be more conscious of the sins that we are doing against ourselves and against others to contemplate on the mercy of Christ how he himself suffered innocently how he has shed his blood for us how he too was misjudged how he too was falsely accused and how Jesus bought all our sins on our sufferings in his body he understands what it means to be a sinner  understand what it means to be hurt to trayed to be taken advantage of and the Lord bears all this in his body and so that is today if we find this journey of life difficult sometimes we are the sinners sometimes we have sinned against others so let us look at the cross to find strength to find hope and most of all to find healing grace for at the end the day it is loved it is compassion it is forgiveness that can set us free amen
