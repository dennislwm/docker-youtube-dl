Repentance of sins is the prerequisite for us to receive the grace of God and His blessings. Forgiveness of sins is already given even before we repent. And so,  we need to try to understand what is it that comes first. Is it God's forgiveness then we repent? Or we repent and then we receive God's forgiveness? Although God has forgiven us,
we need to repent to receive His forgiveness. Forgiveness is there. It is given. But although given, it does not mean that you have received. That is two different things. And so, how then can we really enter to receive the forgiveness?

To receive the forgiveness presupposes that we encounter the Lord Jesus. And I think it's an overwhelming love of Christ that helps us to recognise that God is the one who takes the initiative of bringing our reconciliation. So, forgiveness is always the initiative God. It's not man. It's not that we want to be forgiven. It is God who reaches out to us, who extends the forgiveness and we are the people who receive. But we need to receive, otherwise the forgiveness is not ours.
