The baby Jesus that we celebrate is not just another baby. It's not just an ordinary baby.

This baby as the angels announced is Christ our Lord, the Saviour who is born to us. That is the basis for the Christian celebration of Christmas. So the identity of Jesus defines how we will celebrate this event. The Father cannot be known except through the Son. We will never know the fullness of God, if not for Jesus, because Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the Life. The only way we can fully say we know the Father is because Jesus is the image of the Father. Jesus is truly God and truly man. This assertion of Jesus' two natures are important because it means that from now on, man participates in the life of God through Jesus. And that it is through Jesus' humanity,
we come to know the divinity of God. "If you really want to live an authentic life, then you must be like Jesus. Your life must be one of giving, humble service. The more you give yourself, then this is how you find life.

Is you life spent in humble service of others?
That is the key to the fullness of life. At the end of the day, it boils down to faith in Jesus. Do you believe that Jesus is  Christ? If you believe, you can submit your life, you can surrender your life to Him. So let us pray that as we continue to deepen our understanding, our experience of Jesus as the Christ, we too can then go and say to people and to reveal His identity to all.
